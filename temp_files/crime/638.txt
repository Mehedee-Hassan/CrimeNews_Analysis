However, opponents including states and refugee advocacy groups sued to stop it, disputing its security rationale and saying it discriminated against Muslims.\n\nWatson said in Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s ruling he \xe2\x80\x98declines to usurp the prerogative of the Supreme Court to interpret its own order.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nA spokesman for the Hawaii attorney general\xe2\x80\x99s office said that it would refile the request to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn a statement, the Justice Department said it was pleased with the ruling.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We are confident that the US Supreme Court will again vindicate the president and his constitutional duty to protect the national security of the United States,\xe2\x80\x99 it added.\n\nAfter last month\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Court ruling, the government said that a \xe2\x80\x98bona fide relationship\xe2\x80\x99 meant close family members only, such as parents, spouses, fianc\xc3\xa9s, siblings and children.\n\nGrandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen would still be banned.\n\nThe state of Hawaii asked Watson last week to clarify the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, arguing the government\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x98bona fide relationship\xe2\x80\x99 was too narrow.\n\nJustice Department lawyers said its definition \xe2\x80\x98hews closely\xe2\x80\x99 to language found in US immigration law, while Hawaii\xe2\x80\x99s attorney general office said other parts of immigration law included grandparents as close family.\n\nThe government reversed its position on fianc\xc3\xa9s before the ban went into effect last week, saying they could also qualify for exceptions.\n\nThe roll-out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued last week compared to January, when Trump first signed a more expansive version of the order. That sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world."
