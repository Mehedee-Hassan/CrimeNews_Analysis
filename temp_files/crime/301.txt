Many of them were smuggled or trafficked to Thailand, Malaysia and beyond.\n\nThe Rohingya issue posed a threat to Malaysia's own security, Malaysia's foreign ministry said, adding that the high number of Rohingya in Malaysia and other neighbouring countries made this an \xe2\x80\x98international matter\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nMyanmar's deputy director general of the President's Office U Zaw Htay told the Myanmar Times on Friday that Malaysia should respect sovereign affairs.\n\nMalaysia summoned Myanmar's ambassador last week over the crackdown on Rohingya. It also cancelled the national soccer team's friendly under-22 matches with Myanmar in protest.\n\nSenior government leaders, led by Najib, are expected to participate in the solidarity march on Sunday."
