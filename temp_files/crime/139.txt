b'Trump admin defends interpretation of travel ban ruling..Trump admin defends interpretation of travel ban ruling.\nThe administration of US president Donald Trump opposed opening the door to grandparents from six Muslim-majority countries on Monday, arguing in a court filing that the government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of how to implement its temporary travel ban is based on US immigration law.\n\nThe US Supreme Court in a ruling last Monday revived parts of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s March 6 executive order that banned people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, which had been blocked by lower courts.\n\nThe highest court let the ban go forward with a limited scope, saying that it cannot apply to anyone with credible \xe2\x80\x98bona fide relationship\xe2\x80\x99 with a US person or entity. Trump said the measure was necessary to prevent terrorist attacks.\n\nBut opponents, including states and refugee advocacy groups, sued to stop it, disputing its security rationale and saying it discriminates against Muslims.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court ruling, the government said that a \xe2\x80\x98bona fide relationship\xe2\x80\x99 means close family members only: parents, spouses, siblings and children. Grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins from the six countries would still be banned.\n\nThe government\xe2\x80\x99s definition, \xe2\x80\x98hews closely to the categorical determinations articulated by Congress in the Immigration and Nationality Act,\xe2\x80\x99 Department of Justice lawyers argued in court papers on Monday.\n\nThe government\xe2\x80\x99s filing came after the State of Hawaii last week went to US district judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu, who originally ruled to block the ban, to seek clarification of the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, arguing the government\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x98bona fide relationship\xe2\x80\x99 was too narrow.\n\nThe government said Hawaii, and refugee organisations that filed a \xe2\x80\x98friend of the court\xe2\x80\x99 brief in support of the state, were seeking to apply \xe2\x80\x98broader, free-hand rules.\xe2\x80\x99 The refugee organisations had argued that their work to resettle refugees, a process that can take years of work in coordination with the US government, qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x98bona fide\xe2\x80\x99 relationship with a US entity.\n\nAny refugees with such a relationship should be exempt from the three-month ban on refugees included in the executive order, according to the Supreme Court ruling. But the government said workers with offers of employment with a US company and international students are fundamentally different than refugees receiving help from US resettlement agencies.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98A refugee\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with the agency flows from the government, not from an independent relationship between the refugee and the resettlement agency,\xe2\x80\x99 the government said in its brief. \xe2\x80\x98Indeed, resettlement agencies typically do not have any direct contact with the refugees they assure before their arrival in the United States.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nUsing the organisation\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation would make the refugee provisions in the executive order \xe2\x80\x98largely meaningless,\xe2\x80\x99 the government said.\n\nUS refugee resettlement is continuing as normal until July 6, the state department has said, around when the 50,000 cap for the fiscal year set by Trump\xe2\x80\x99s executive order is likely to be reached.\n\nLate on Thursday, before the ban went into effect, the government reversed its position on fianc\xc3\xa9s, saying they could also qualify for exceptions. The court filing described a 72-hour scramble to \xe2\x80\x98coordinate among multiple government agencies, and issue detailed guidance\xe2\x80\x99 on how to implement the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling.\n\nThe roll out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued on Friday compared to in January when Trump first signed a more expansive version of the order, sparking protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world.\n\n\n\n'
