b'We need to stand up for encryption..We need to stand up for encryption.\nTHE \xe2\x80\x98Five Eyes\xe2\x80\x99 is a surveillance partnership of intelligence agencies consisting of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. According to a joint communiqu\xc3\xa9 issued after the meeting, officials discussed encryption and access to data. The communiqu\xc3\xa9 states that \xe2\x80\x98encryption can severely undermine public safety efforts by impeding lawful access to the content of communications during investigations into serious crimes, including terrorism.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nIn the letter organised by Access Now, CIPPIC, and researchers from Citizen Lab, 83 groups and security experts wrote, \xe2\x80\x98we call on you to respect the right to use and develop strong encryption.\xe2\x80\x99 Signatories also urged the members of the ministerial meeting to commit to allowing public participation in any future discussions.\n\nVoices on Five Eyes\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Massive surveillance operations conducted by the Five Eyes partnership inherently put the human rights of people around the world at risk. The joint communiqu\xc3\xa9 commits to human rights and the rule of law, but provides no detail as to how these powerful, secretive spy agencies plan to live up to those commitments. We call for public participation and meaningful accountability now; otherwise, those commitments are empty.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 Amie Stepanovich, US policy manager at Access Now\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Our political leaders are putting people around the world at greater risk of crime when they call for greater powers to weaken our digital security. Security experts and cryptographers are as united in their views on encryption as scientists are on climate change. Politicians need to listen to them before they make decisions that could put us all at risk.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 Jim Killock, ORG\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Attempting to undermine the free use and development of strong encryption technology is not only technologically misguided, it is politically irresponsible. Both law enforcement and intelligence agencies have access to more data \xe2\x80\x94 and more powerful analytical tools \xe2\x80\x94 than ever before in human history. Measures that undermine the efficacy or public availability of encryption will never be proportionate when weighed against their profound threat to global human rights: encryption is essential to the preservation of freedom of opinion, expression, dissent, and democratic engagement. Without it, meaningful privacy, trust, and safety in the digital sphere would not be possible.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 Lex Gill, research fellow, Citizen Lab, Munk School of Global Affairs\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Encryption protects billions of ordinary people worldwide from criminals and authoritarian regimes. Agencies charged with protecting national security shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be trying to undermine a cornerstone of security in the digital age.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 Cynthia Wong, senior internet researcher, Human Rights Watch\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Encryption is used by governments, businesses, and citizens alike to secure communications, safeguard personal information, and conduct business online. Deliberately weakening encryption threatens the integrity of governance, the safety of online commerce, and the interpersonal relationships that compose our daily lives. We must not sacrifice our core values to the threat of terrorism: the solution to such threats must entail better protecting our basic rights and the technologies that advance them.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 Christopher Parsons, research associate and managing director of the Telecom Transparency Project at the Citizen Lab, Munk School of Global Affairs\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Calls to undermine encryption in the name of \xe2\x80\x98national security\xe2\x80\x99 are fundamentally misguided and dangerous. Encryption is a necessary and critical tool enabling individual privacy, a free media, online commerce and the operations of organisations of all types, including of course government agencies. Undermining encryption therefore represents a serious threat to national security in its own right, as well as threatening basic human rights and the enormous economic and social benefits that the digital revolution has brought for people across the globe.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 Jon Lawrence, EFA\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Assurances of strong encryption not only benefit civil liberties and privacy, but the economy as well. A vibrant and dynamic internet economy is only possible if consumers and users trust the environment in which they\xe2\x80\x99re conducting business. While law enforcement and intelligence services have legitimate concerns over their ability to access data, those concerns need to be balanced with the benefits encryption provides to average users transacting in cyberspace. A strong internet economy, buttressed by the trust that encryption produces, is vital to national interests around the globe. National policies should support and defend, not weaken and abridge, access to encryption.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 Ryan Hagemann, Niskanen Center\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The strength of the tools and techniques that our government and members of the public have and use to secure our nation and protect our privacy is of significant public interest. Transparency and accountability around a nation\xe2\x80\x99s policy regarding the use of encryption is a bedrock importance in a democracy, particularly given the potential of backdoors to put billions of online users at greater risk for intrusion, compromise of personal data, and breaches of massive consumer or electoral databases. The democracies in the \xe2\x80\x98Five Eyes\xe2\x80\x99 should be open and accountable to their publics about not only the existence of these discussions but their content, removing any gap between what is being proposed and the consent of those governed by those policies.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 Alex Howard, Sunlight Foundation\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Encryption is a vital tool for journalists, activists, and everyone whose lives and work depend on using the internet securely. It allows reporters to protect their confidential sources from reprisal, and to fearlessly pursue stories that powerful actors don\xe2\x80\x99t want told. It offers protection from mortal danger for dissidents trying the communicate under repressive regimes. Undermining the integrity of encryption puts lives at risk, and runs directly counter to the mandate of the Five Eyes Signals Intelligence agencies to keep their citizens safe.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 Tom Henheffer, executive director, Canadian Journalists for Free Expression\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The answer to concerns on \xe2\x80\x98going dark\xe2\x80\x99 is to help bring our law enforcement and counterterrorism officials into the future, not send encryption to the past. We hope to hear back from the Five Eyes that they were looking for how to adapt to digital security measures, not break them to the detriment of everyday Americans and our national security. As Five Eyes leaders work on a strategy to protect against cyber attacks, it is important to have a transparent process and cooperation between governments and civil society without stifling innovation or weakening other parts of security.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 Austin Carson, executive director, TechFreedom\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Strong encryption is essential for modern society. Broken technologies undermine commerce, security, and human rights.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 Jeramie Scott, EPIC\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Any attempt by the UK government to attack encrypted messengers would be nothing less than an attack on the right to a private conversation. Far from making the internet safer, by undermining the technology that protects everything from our bank accounts to our private conversations, governments around the world are putting us all at risk. Transparency is vital around any coordinated plans that could jeopardise both our security and our rights.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 Silkie Carlo, Policy Officer, Liberty\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We increasingly rely on a secure internet for work, personal relationships, commerce, and politics. While we support justifiable lawful intercept with appropriate oversight, we don\xe2\x80\x99t think we should be seriously weakening the security of the internet to achieve it. Attempts to weaken encryption will do more damage to our society and our freedom than the possible threats it\xe2\x80\x99s meant to be protecting us from.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 Thomas Beagle, chairperson, NZ Council for Civil Liberties\n\n\xe2\x80\x98All sensitive personal data must be encrypted as a matter of human rights to privacy, especially health data, ie, all information about our minds and bodies, wherever it exists. Today health data is the most valuable personal data of all, the most attractive to hackers, and the most sold and traded by the massive, hidden global health data broker industry.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 Dr. Deborah Peel, Patient Privacy Rights\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We lock our devices for good reason. Introducing backdoors weakens security and violates our right to privacy. The very existence of backdoors means unwelcome guests will come knocking.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 Linda Sherry, director of national priorities, Consumer Action\n\nOpenDemocracy.net, July 4.
