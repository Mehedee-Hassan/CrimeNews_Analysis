They didn't stop running when soldiers asked,\xe2\x80\x99 said Juha, 32, adding that fear of the soldiers had prompted some villagers to arm themselves with makeshift weapons.\n\nThe bloodshed in Myothugyi may have been replicated elsewhere, according to information gathered by international aid groups working in Rakhine State and advocacy group the Arakan Project.\n\nReuters was unable to verify the information, however.\n\nSchools and markets remain shut amid the military and police hunt for those behind Sunday's attacks. Authorities have called a curfew in Maungdaw from 7:00pm to 6:00am, and barred gatherings of five or more.\n\nIn one of the attacks, officials say, 90 people, believed to be Rohingyas, targeted a border police headquarters and made off with more than 60 weapons and 10,000 rounds of ammunition.\n\nTwo Muslim men captured during Sunday's attacks have reportedly confessed, Rakhine State police Major Sein Lwin told Reuters.\n\nThe men, charged with murder, conspiracy to murder and the assault of civil servants, said the attacks had been planned by a single \xe2\x80\x98leader,\xe2\x80\x99 Sein Lwin added.\n\nHe declined to name the leader, but said he had ties to an unnamed armed group operating across the Bangladesh border, which Myanmar has closed, and where Bangladesh has stepped up patrols.\n\nNobel laureate Suu Kyi, who leads Myanmar's six-month old civilian administration, has faced criticism for failing to tackle rights abuses against the Rohingya and other Muslims.\n\nIn August, she appointed former UN chief Kofi Annan to chair an advisory panel on Rakhine State that visited the area for the first time in September, but has yet to go to the northern Muslim-majority townships.\n\nThe violence in 2012 killed more than 100 people and left about 125,000, mostly Rohingya, unable to return home."
