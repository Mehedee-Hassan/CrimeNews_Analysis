Her political activities inspired many ethnic minority people, particularly women. Her abduction had outraged the nation.\n\nDifferent organisations of hill people, including the Hill Women\xe2\x80\x99s Federation, have taken elaborate programmes to mark the 21th anniversary of the disappearance of Kalpana Chakma.\n\nNaripokkho, a non-governmental organisation working for women\xe2\x80\x99s rights, in a release on Sunday, demanded the immediate steps to find out all who became victims to enforced disappearance, including Kalpana Chakma.'
