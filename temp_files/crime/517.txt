The teenagers agreed to change their clothing and take a later flight, Guerin said, but the airline\xe2\x80\x99s actions sparked a quick backlash on Twitter.\n\nActivist Shannon Watts of Denver tweeted that she witnessed Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s events and questioned United\xe2\x80\x99s decision to police women\xe2\x80\x99s clothing.\n\nWatts said the girl\xe2\x80\x99s father was allowed to board while wearing shorts and called the airline\xe2\x80\x99s policy sexist.\n\nRegularly ticketed passengers are not subject to the same dress code and can wear leggings, Guerin said. But the airline was standing by its policy for pass travelers because they are essentially representing the company, he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We would ask the same of pass riders who were wearing flip-flops or who were wearing clothing that revealed their undergarments or torn, tattered jeans,\xe2\x80\x99 Guerin said.'
