The Bengalis also made no such complaint about any attack earlier.\n\nThe case was filed at a time when the arson-affected ethnic minorities were yet to return to their homesteads and still living at shelters and deep forests even after 20 days of the arson attack, following recovery of the body of a local Juba League leader, the\n\nruling Awami League-backed youth organisation.\n\nLangadu police officer-in-charge Mominul Islam said that he heard about filing of the case by Bengalis but no such documents reached to the police station yet.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We are investigating the previous cases [filed by police and ethnic minority people] over the arson attack and if any such case is filed by Bengalis, we would investigate it altogether,\xe2\x80\x99 he told New Age on Thursday.\n\nLangadu upazila unit Awami League general secretary Jane Alam, who was made witness of the new case, claimed that the houses of Bengalis were also set on fire by ethnic minorities.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98There are criminals in ethnic community and they should be brought to book,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We could not measure the damages of houses earlier,\xe2\x80\x99 he said about the delay in filing the case.\n\nPanic griped the ethnic minority people after they came to know about the case on Thursday.
