It is vital that the ceasefire agreed to by the parties is carried out immediately,\xe2\x80\x99 said UN special representative on CAR, Parfait Onanga-Anyanga.\n\nBattling between armed groups in the Bria area from May 15 to 18 left five people dead, 29 wounded and more than 40,000 others displaced, according to the UN.\n\nClashes in Bria, Alindao, Bangassou and Mobaye, east of the capital Bangui, resulted in a total of around 300 dead and 200 wounded, according to the UN\xe2\x80\x99s humanitarian coordination agency OCHA.'
