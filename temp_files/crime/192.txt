The elderly and weak are carried across mounds of rubble in blankets. Soldiers \xe2\x80\x94 increasingly fearful of the Old City\xe2\x80\x99s inhabitants after a string of suicide bombings \xe2\x80\x94 hurry the groups along.\n\nA middle-aged woman with a gaunt, pale face fainted as she fled past the destroyed al-Nuri Mosque. Two soldiers carried her to the roadside and tried to revive her with cold water.\n\nLargely cut off from food and water for months, humanitarian groups are reporting a spike in the number of displaced people suffering from malnutrition and dehydration.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98None of the previous battles were like this,\xe2\x80\x99 said Iraqi Major Faris Aboud, working at a small field hospital just outside the Old City.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98In a single day we received 300 wounded,\xe2\x80\x99 Aboud, a father of three continued. \xe2\x80\x98For me, seeing the wounded children is the hardest, we see children who have lost their entire families under the rubble, they have no one now.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nLieutenant General Abdel Ghani al-Asadi, of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s special forces, said earlier in the day that Iraqi forces are just 250 meters (yards) from the Tigris River, in the western half of Mosul. The Tigris divides the city roughly into its western and eastern half, which was liberated from IS militants back in January.\n\nIS militants who remain trapped in just a few hundred meters of territory in the Old City are now in a \xe2\x80\x98fight to the death,\xe2\x80\x99 al-Asadi said, adding that IS fighters are increasingly resorting to suicide bombings and that he expects the fighting to get even heavier as they are pushed closer to the river.\n\nIraqi forces marked a significant victory this week when the Rapid Response Division retook Mosul\xe2\x80\x99s main hospital complex on the city\xe2\x80\x99s western side.\n\nThe building that once held the city\xe2\x80\x99s best medical facilities now sits devastated by the fight. For weeks, a handful of IS snipers perched in the main hospital\xe2\x80\x99s top floors held back hundreds of Iraqi forces.\n\nIraqi forces launched the operation to retake Mosul, the country\xe2\x80\x99s second largest city, in October. IS overran Mosul in a matter of days in 2014. At the height of the extremists\xe2\x80\x99 power, they held nearly a third of Iraq.\n\nA man who asked to only be referred to as Abu Abid, for fear for his family\xe2\x80\x99s safety, was waiting to get a spot on a truck after fleeing the Old City.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98That place, it was absolute death,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98We will never be the same. Once the fear has been planted in your heart, you can\xe2\x80\x99t get rid of it.\xe2\x80\x99'
