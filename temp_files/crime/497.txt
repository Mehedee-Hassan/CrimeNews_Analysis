The victims include Vallenilla and another youth killed on Monday near the same base. In both incidents, soldiers were caught on camera with guns pointing at the protesters.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I want to speak to my former colleague of the Caracas Metro, Nicolas Maduro, you know that we worked together, I'm supervisor Vallenilla ... I was your boss,\xe2\x80\x99 said the slain protester's father, also named David Vallenilla, referring to the years when Maduro worked as a bus driver.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I want to make sure this is resolved Nicolas, please, he wasn't a criminal, he was a graduating student ... please friend,\xe2\x80\x99 the elder Vallenilla told reporters outside a morgue as tears streamed down his face. \xe2\x80\x98You met him when he was little.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nReuters was unable to immediately confirm the link between Vallenilla and Maduro.\n\nMaduro, who makes frequent reference to his former job as a bus driver to highlight his working-class roots, calls the protests an effort to violently remove him from office with the backing of ideological adversaries in Washington.\n\nHowever, the president condemned the latest \xe2\x80\x98painful\xe2\x80\x99 deaths and ordered a newly promoted general to make sure that \xe2\x80\x98nobody else falls.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nSpeaking at a Friday event where he gave new positions to several military officials, Maduro said, \xe2\x80\x98The use of firearms is prohibited and I ratify the prohibition.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nDefence minister Nestor Reverol had earlier offered an unusually swift condemnation of Vallenilla's shooting by a military officer, and state ombudsman Tarek Saab called it a \xe2\x80\x98vile murder\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nOpposition leaders have vowed to remain in the streets to demonstrate against what many are now calling a dictatorship and to demand a solution to economic crisis that has created chronic shortages of staple goods and left millions struggling to eat.\n\nThe crisis has brought strong words from world leaders and diplomatic efforts to build dialogue between Maduro and his critics.\n\nAt Maduro's insistence, Venezuela is due to elect a new popular assembly next month to rewrite the constitution. Critics say Maduro will use it to consolidate power and keep adversaries in jail.\n\nAround Caracas on Friday, demonstrators burned tires and blocked roads while chanting slogans that included \xe2\x80\x98No To Dictatorship\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Murderer, Maduro\xe2\x80\x99 to protest Vallenilla's death.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We don't have weapons, the only option we have is to shut down the country,\xe2\x80\x99 said Joselyn Almeida who walked out of her office with colleagues to join around 100 people in blocking a main avenue in the upscale district of Las Mercedes.\n\nOfficials say the recent wave of street protests across Venezuela, often resulting in vandalism, have arbitrarily restricted free transit and commerce and even prevented ambulances from reaching hospitals.\n\nA group of demonstrators on Friday returned to the spot where Vallenilla was killed. They set three trucks on fire and pushed one of them against the fence of the air base, which they later partially tore down.\n\n\n\nOpposition leaders said the demonstrators were not part of the broader protest and insisted the incident was staged by the government to tarnish the protest movement."
