Eight attackers were killed and two captured, police said.\n\nThe Rohingya, who are mostly stateless and are subject to severe restrictions on their movements, make up the majority of the population in the northern part of Rakhine State.\n\nAuthorities in the township of Maungdaw on Sunday announced the extension of an existing order banning gatherings of five or more people and imposing a 7:00pm to 6:00am curfew.\n\nState media said the military - known as the Tatmadaw - had moved troops into the area by helicopter. Photographs on social media showed trucks full of infantry purportedly being deployed in the area.\n\nNo detailed information has been released about the operation in the area near a border guard office at Kyiganbyin village, where as many as 90 assailants seized weapons and fled into the hills.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The Tatmadaw, the police force and the Ministry of Border Affairs are working together to ensure security and restore law and order,\xe2\x80\x99 said Min Aung, a minister in the Rakhine State government, who declined to disclose the size of the force sent to the area.\n\nHuman rights advocates raised concerns that civilians may be caught up in the sweep. Unverified reports posted online by advocates for the Rohingya suggested that a violent crackdown may be underway.\n\nYe Htut, administrator for Maungdaw, said he was not aware of the situation around Kyiganbyin village, which is under the control of security forces.\n\nMuslim residents of Maungdaw town closed their shops amid the heightened security presence, he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98All of the security forces are deployed in Maungdaw, so we are not worried about security. Everything is fine,\xe2\x80\x99 Ye Htut said.\n\nMatthew Smith, founder of campaign group Fortify Rights, said restrictions on the Muslim population already in place made northern Rakhine State \xe2\x80\x98a police state, an apartheid state\xe2\x80\x99.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Human rights violations in the context of counterinsurgency in northern Rakhine State are not new,\xe2\x80\x99 Smith said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The authorities routinely accuse average Rohingya of involvement with armed extremists.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nAuthorities routinely dismiss accusations of rights abuses.\n\nSunday was the bloodiest day in the state since 2012, when more than 100 people were killed in clashes between Rohingya and ethnic Rakhine Buddhists. Some 125,000 people, the majority Rohingya, remain displaced.\n\nMyanmar's state counsellor and foreign minister Aung San Suu Kyi - who in August appointed former UN chief Kofi Annan to head an advisory commission into the situation in Rakhine State - discussed the attacks with security officials in an emergency meeting on Sunday, said foreign ministry official Kyaw Tin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The state counsellor instructed us to handle this issue cautiously in accordance with the law,\xe2\x80\x99 Kyaw Tin told reporters.\n\nOfficials in Bangladesh said Myanmar had closed the border after the attacks.\n\nBangladesh deployed additional border guards, said Mohammad Tanvir Alam Khan, a Border Guard Bangladesh commander.\n\nMyanmar police chief Zaw Win has said his force was investigating possible links between the attackers and rebel groups.\n\nZaw Win also mentioned big drugs busts by police in the area - some 6 million methamphetamine pills were seized in September - as a possible trigger for the attacks."
