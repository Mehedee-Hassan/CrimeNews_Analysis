b'EU ministers pledge steps to tackle migrant flood..EU ministers pledge steps to tackle migrant flood.\nEU interior ministers on Thursday pledged to back an urgent European Commission plan to help crisis-hit Italy, which has been overwhelmed by a wave of migrants arriving by sea from North Africa.\n\nMinisters from across the bloc gathered in the Estonian capital Tallinn after Italy, which has accepted around\n\n85,000 of the 100,000 people who have arrived this year, appealed desperately for help.\n\nAt the close of the talks, ministers issued a rare written statement, saying: \xe2\x80\x98The situation in the Central Mediterranean and the resulting pressure on Italy is of great concern to all member states.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nThe move was hailed by Italian interior minister Marco Minniti.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98There has been a recognition of the question raised by Italy,\xe2\x80\x99 he said of the talks that were chaired by Estonia, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union.\n\nMost of those landing in Italy are sub-Saharan Africans who have crossed the Mediterranean from Libya, a journey that has so far claimed more than 2,200 lives this year, UN figures show.\n\nIn recent weeks, Italy has stepped up calls for help, pleading with its European partners to make a \xe2\x80\x98concrete contribution\xe2\x80\x99 by opening their ports to rescue ships to share the burden.\n\nAt the end of June, Italy threatened to stop vessels from other countries disembarking rescued migrants at its ports.\n\nAnd the influx has exacerbated tensions with neighbouring Austria, which this week threatened to send troops to its border with Italy to stop migrants entering.\n\nCentral to Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s talks was a European Commission plan which earmarks 35 million euros ($40 million) in aid for Rome as well as proposals for working with Libya and other countries to stem the flow of migrants at source.\n\nMinisters expressed support for the plan as well as for a proposed \xe2\x80\x98code of conduct\xe2\x80\x99 to regulate non-governmental organisations (NGOs) on rescue missions patrolling off the coast of Libya.\n\nDespite their humanitarian mission, aid groups have come under fire with some critics saying their presence is like a magnet encouraging migrants to attempt the crossing.\n\nBut the groups say that not acting would risk lives with smugglers putting migrants out to sea in increasingly unseaworthy vessels with little fuel or water.\n\nMeanwhile in Rome, top diplomats from the EU and Africa met officials from the United Nations and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) over the ongoing crisis.\n\nThe talks grouped foreign ministers from Libya, Niger, Tunisia, Egypt, Chad, Ethiopia and Sudan with their counterparts from Germany, Austria, Spain, France, The Netherlands, Malta and Estonia.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98In order to lower the number of people arriving here, we must reduce the number arriving in Libya,\xe2\x80\x99 Italian foreign minister Angelino Alfano said after the talks.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98If border controls in transit countries are effective, then the \xe2\x80\x98tickets\xe2\x80\x99 sold by the biggest criminal travel agency in history would lose their value.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98If the traffickers can\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee an arrival in Europe, their travel agency would go bankrupt,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98That is our mission.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nEarlier, French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said all actions would \xe2\x80\x98focus first and foremost\xe2\x80\x99 on Libya. \xe2\x80\x98The priority must be finding a solution to the crisis in this key country,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\nThe ministers ended by issuing a statement calling for investment to help young people and women in the countries of origin, as well as supporting beefed up border controls in such countries.\n\nThey also agreed to help the UN refugee agency and the IOM increase their presence along the migrant trail and develop communication strategies to warn potential migrants about the dangers of the journey.\n\nUnveiled on Tuesday, the European plan proposes support for the Libyan authorities through a joint rescue coordination centre which would improve the rescue efforts with Libya\xe2\x80\x99s coastguard and offer it better training and equipment.\n\nIt also proposes to help Libya strengthen control over its porous southern border while working with Egypt, Niger, Ethiopia and Sudan to improve the repatriation process for migrants who don\xe2\x80\x99t meet the criteria for international protection.\n\nBut an analysis by the Eurasia Group think tank said the EU\xe2\x80\x99s response was likely to be \xe2\x80\x98timid\xe2\x80\x99 with the new measures expected to only \xe2\x80\x98marginally stem the migrant flow\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nUnder the EU\xe2\x80\x99s asylum policy, asylum seekers are supposed to be processed in the country where they first arrive.'
