b'Myanmar policeman fled deadly mob attack on Rohingyas..Myanmar policeman fled deadly mob attack on Rohingyas.\nA policeman in Myanmar fled the scene of a deadly mob attack on Rohingya Muslims that has put the troubled western state of Rakhine on edge, two police officials said on Wednesday.\n\nA group of Rakhine Buddhists threw bricks at Rohingya men in the state capital of Sittwe on Tuesday, killing one - identified as Maung Nu, also known as Monir Ahmad, 55 - the office of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi said in a statement.\n\nTwo police officers told Reuters an unarmed junior policeman was with the Muslim men at the time of the attack but was unable to protect them from the mob.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We questioned the young policeman. He said he tried to stop them but he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to and ran away back to the police station,\xe2\x80\x99 said Colonel Myo Thu Soe, spokesman for the home affairs ministry in the capital, Naypyidaw.\n\nNo one had been arrested for the attack, but an investigation was going on, he said.\n\nRakhine State has seen the most serious religious violence in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar since the military began to end its decades of strict rule, with hundreds of Rohingya Muslims killed and more than 140,000 people displaced there in communal unrest in 2012.\n\nSuu Kyi, who came to power last year as part of the transition from military rule, has emphasised the importance of the rule of law in solving conflict between Buddhists and minority Muslims.\n\nTension has been running high in the state since an army crackdown in response to Rohingya insurgent attacks in October, but Sittwe has not seen a repeat of the communal clashes of 2012.\n\nOn Tuesday, seven Muslim men had travelled into Sittwe from a camp on its outskirts housing people displaced in 2012. They got into an argument with a Buddhist ethnic Rakhine man over the purchase of a boat, attracting the attention of residents who began to attack them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The people didn\xe2\x80\x99t attack the police because he\xe2\x80\x99s the same race,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lieutenant Colonel Win Naung of Sittwe district police.\n\nMyanmar does not recognise the more than 1 million Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine as citizens. Many in Myanmar consider the them illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.\n\nMyo Thu Soe said the policeman on the scene was unarmed and inexperienced and unable to protect the Rohingya men.\n\nDespite the fact they had a police escort, Myo Thu Soe said the Muslim men were not authorised to travel to the area.\n\nSince the 2012 violence the city\xe2\x80\x99s Muslims have been confined to camps or a single city ward, unable to travel freely without a police escort.\n\nMore about: Myanmar\n\nRohingya'
