If you (law enforcers) did not do it then find out the truth,' Fakhrul said.\n\n'They (law enforcers) can do everything if they can trace him by 11:00pm, ' he said while talking to journalists at BNP central office.\n\nWriter and columnist Farhad Mazhar had gone missing on Monday morning soon after he went out of his residence in Dhaka city and was rescued by law enforcers in Jessore on Monday night.\n\nFakhrul said the way police are talking, it seemed that Farhad Mazhar had committed an offense.\n\nHe came down hard on the home minister for his comment that they still did not find out any fault of Farhad Mazhar.\n\nFakhrul questioned what does he mean by the remark.\n\nThe incident of abduction took place the day Supreme Court gave verdict striking down 16th amendment to the constitution.\n\nHe thought it was done to divert public attention.\n\nTurning to next general election, Fakhrul hoped that 'ice would melt' saying a way of negotiation would come out through discussion to resolve the present political stalemate over poll-time government.\n\nHe said the government would have to bear liability if the crisis does not overcome.\n\nFakhrul said the BNP did whatever was required to resolve the current political crisis emphasising on holding dialogue.\n\nHe urged the government to sit at a discussion with opposition."
