Clubs also used the excuse of Chikungunya epidemic, making the league perhaps only event in the country to suffer for this mysterious virus.\n\nBFF readily agreed to their demand, taking the league from mid-June to the end of July, saying that it would also facilitate Bangladesh\xe2\x80\x99s participation in AFC Under-23 Championship qualifiers, scheduled in Palestine from July 19 to 23.\n\nIt made Bangladesh perhaps the only country to postpone their main professional league for an age-level AFC qualifiers, said players and officials, struggling to find a similar example elsewhere in the world.\n\nChittagong Abahani coach Saiful Bari Titu summarised the whole scenario, saying that because of scheduling quagmire, he had to conduct pre-season camp three times in a season.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Usually we work with players\xe2\x80\x99 fitness in the pre-season training camp,\xe2\x80\x99 said Titu.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98First I had to conduct the pre-season camp before the Sheikh Kamal International Tournament. Few months later I had to work with the fitness of players second time before the Federation Cup.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Presently I\xe2\x80\x99m conducting another pre-season training camp. It\xe2\x80\x99s a huge hassle for a professional coach.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nArambagh Krira Sangha coach Maruful Haq was also left irritated with the uncertainty over football calendar.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Bangladesh is the only exception because we have to compromise in every step to continue the game,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Our football authorities always fail to follow their own calendar. They have to adjust with many stakeholders to run the football. As consequence of this regular compromise and concession we are now in 192 [190 in latest rankings] in the world ranking,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\nDue to this long gap, some mid-level clubs were forced to suspend their camp.\n\nRahmatganj Muslim Friends Society coach Kamal Babu said it became made the job of a professional coach to work with the fitness of players.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Players often lose their rhythm and had to give an extra effort to regain their fitness,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\nPlayers said they failed to continue their form due to a huge gap between two leagues.\n\nAtiqur Rahman Meshu, a defender of Sheikh Russell Krira Chakra, expressed his frustration over the matter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Due to delay, the season becomes long that also makes the players tired,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\nMamunul Islam, national team captain, urged the BFF to follow the other countries before making the calendar.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98In England we see they remain stick to a fixed calendar. India also tries to maintain their calendar,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98If we can do this, I am sure our league would be more effective.\xe2\x80\x99'
