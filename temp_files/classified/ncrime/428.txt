Bangladesh has recorded consistent fiscal deficits, averaging 3.3 per cent of GDP over the past 10 years.\n\nRepeated delays in implementing the VAT law also\n\npointed to difficulties associated with effective policy reform in Bangladesh. Previous postponements were due to opposition from business owners and other vested interest groups.\n\nDelay this time, in the context of elections scheduled for 2018, indicates the political hurdles to implementing meaningful reforms, it said.\n\n\n\n'
