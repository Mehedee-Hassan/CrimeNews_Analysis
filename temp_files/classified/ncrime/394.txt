The 26-year-old hit 20 goals last season as an important creative influence in the Light Blues\xe2\x80\x99 third-place finish in Serie A.\n\nNapoli retired the No 10 shirt in honour of Maradona back in 2000 \xe2\x80\x93 but now their Argentine legend has joked his old squad number could be back on the table.\n\nMaradona says Insigne, who has scored 49 goals for Napoli so far, can take the No 10 if he surpasses his goal tally of 115.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98If he scores more goals than me, then he can wear it!\xe2\x80\x99 Maradona said. \xe2\x80\x98I hope this can be the right season for the Scudetto, as they have the right experience now not to drop the points where they did last time.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98If they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done that, we\xe2\x80\x99d have been champions already.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I think this is the right moment for Maurizio Sarri, Pepe Reina, Insigne, Dries Mertens and all the others. They can prove that Napoli can win the Scudetto.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nNapoli finished behind Juventus and Roma but they were just five points off the pace at the top of the table, an improvement of four points compared to the previous year\xe2\x80\x99s gap.\n\nBack in the city where he is so revered for his help in taking Napoli to two Serie A triumphs as well as Coppa Italia and UEFA Cup wins, Maradona praised the people of Naples for ensuring memories of him live on at his former club.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Many generations have passed since my day,\xe2\x80\x99 he added. \xe2\x80\x98Now the dads have to find videos of my goals to play to their sons. Even the youngest kids know me in Naples and that makes me very proud.\xe2\x80\x99'
