The same can be said of Spain\xe2\x80\x99s Garbine Muguruza who has faded since winning the 2016 French Open.\n\nTwice champion Petra Kvitova returns to Wimbledon having recovered from injuries sustained in a stabbing last December and the fact that she is being tipped as favourite by many speaks volumes for the vacuum that currently exists.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I said that at least 30 women could win the French, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even have put Ostapenko\xe2\x80\x99s name on the 30 because she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t won a WTA tournament,\xe2\x80\x99 former world number four Gilbert, who will be one of ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s analysts during Wimbledon, said this week as he looked ahead to the championships.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I will double down and say that 40 women could win Wimbledon. The field, without a doubt, is the clear favourite.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nIncredibly, since Williams won the Australian Open no fewer than 22 players have won titles on the WTA Tour.\n\nOnly world number five Elina Svitolina from Ukraine, with four, and Russian world number 17 Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, with two, have managed multiple titles since the Australian Open.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I think at the top of the game, it\xe2\x80\x99s very chaotic right now. I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of fragility,\xe2\x80\x99 18-times grand slam winner Evert told an ESPN conference call.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I think the players that have been at the top have not lived up to their billing. I feel terrible saying that, but everyone who\xe2\x80\x99s reached number one, they haven\xe2\x80\x99t carried on the momentum, and they haven\xe2\x80\x99t stepped up and really embraced that position of leadership on and off the court.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98You really can\xe2\x80\x99t count on any one player right now like you could count on Serena in the past.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nThere are signs though that a brash new brigade, led by Ostapenko, could start to usher the old guard, the likes of the still dangerous Svetlana Kuznetsova, Venus Williams and Agnieszka Radwanska, out of the limelight.\n\nSvitolina, 22, Madison Keys, 22, and Croatian Ana Konjuh, 19, are in a similar mould to Ostapenko, as is Estonia\xe2\x80\x99s 21-year-old Anett Kontaveit who could be a dark horse at Wimbledon after winning the grasscourt title in Den Bosch this month.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Everything is really open, everyone can win,\xe2\x80\x99 she told Reuters. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s great for women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis. It\xe2\x80\x99s interesting to watch and to follow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98It gets a little boring if it\xe2\x80\x99s always the same people.\xe2\x80\x99'
