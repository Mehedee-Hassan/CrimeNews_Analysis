He deserves it as much as anyone out here. He has had his fair share of heartbreak. I played well. He made a great comeback.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nOnly three players had more major starts without a victory than Garcia before he donned the green jacket symbolic of Masters supremacy after nearly two decades of major futility.\n\nGarcia led by three strokes after five holes, fell two behind after 11, then roared back to force the playoff and sank a 15-foot birdie putt to claim victory.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Even after making a couple of bogeys I was very positive. I still believed,\xe2\x80\x99 Garcia said. \xe2\x80\x98There were a lot of holes I could get to and I stayed positive.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nRose\xe2\x80\x99s playoff tee shot soared deep into trees right of the fairway but bounced out onto pine straw while Garcia found the fairway.\n\nRose could only punch out onto the fairway and scrambled to make a bogey while Garcia put his approach 15 feet from the hole and, needing only two putts to win, rolled in a birdie around the edge of the cup.\n\nGarcia squatted and shook with excitement, rose and screamed with joy and hugged good pal Rose before walking around the green to revel in the moment, pumping his fist and punching the green in delight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We were cheering each other,\xe2\x80\x99 Garcia said. \xe2\x80\x98We wanted to beat the other guy not the other guy to lose.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nGarcia said he had lost hope of ever winning at Augusta, but \xe2\x80\x98through the years I learned to accept what Augusta gives and takes and that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m here.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nOn the 72nd regulation hole, Rose missed an eight-foot birdie putt, leaving Garcia a five-footer to win, but he pushed it wide right.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought I had it on 18,\xe2\x80\x99 Garcia said. \xe2\x80\x98I hit it where I wanted.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nAmong Twitter notes of congratulations were: \xe2\x80\x98I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be happier for @TheSergioGarcia. You deserve it all amigo,\xe2\x80\x99 from second-ranked Rory McIlroy and \xe2\x80\x98Congrats, well earned,\xe2\x80\x99 from 14-time major winner Tiger Woods.'
