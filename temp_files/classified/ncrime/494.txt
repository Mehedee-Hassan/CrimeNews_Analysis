I tried to focus on my game plan, I was serving well and when it mattered I made a break,\xe2\x80\x99 said Djokovic, who is aiming to win a first Grand Slam title since last year\xe2\x80\x99s French Open.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98It was great to be back on Centre Court. It\xe2\x80\x99s the cradle of tennis history and it\xe2\x80\x99s a special feeling to walk on, but you never like to end a match this way.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nIt was the kind of trouble-free first round Djokovic would have been hoping for after the most turbulent period of his career.\n\nThe world number four crashed out in the third round at Wimbledon last year and has struggled badly in 2017, the 12-time major winner losing in the Australian Open second round and the French Open quarter-finals.\n\nWith defending champion Serena Williams sidelined while she prepares to give birth to her first child, the race to win the women\xe2\x80\x99s title is the most wide open in a generation.\n\nWorld number one Kerber, the 2016 Australian and US Open winner, is among the favourites after reaching last year\xe2\x80\x99s final, which she lost to Serena.\n\nThe German has failed to maintain that form this season and her poor run culminated in an embarrassing French Open first round loss to Ekaterina Makarova last month.\n\nBut the top seed showed glimpses of her best form as she saw off American qualifier Irina Falconi 6-4, 6-4 in 87 minutes on Centre Court.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to be back, but this year is completely different for me. I\xe2\x80\x99m just happy I\xe2\x80\x99m through the first round,\xe2\x80\x99 Kerber said.\n\nMilos Raonic, last year\xe2\x80\x99s men\xe2\x80\x99s runner-up, advanced to the second round with a 7-6 (7/5), 6-2, 7-6 (7/4) win against Jan-Lennard Struff.\n\nBig-serving Raonic became the first Canadian man to make a Grand Slam final with his impressive Wimbledon run 12 months ago before losing the title match to Andy Murray.\n\nThe sixth seed made a business-like start to his bid to make a second major final, in the process extended German world number 53 Struff\xe2\x80\x99s losing streak at Grand Slams to 10 matches.\n\nFrench 22nd seed Richard Gasquet slumped to a 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 6-2 loss against Spain\xe2\x80\x99s David Ferrer.\n\nIt was the first time Gasquet, a two-time Wimbledon semi-finalist, had lost in the first round since 2006.\n\nArgentina\xe2\x80\x99s Juan Martin Del Potro, a semi-finalist in 2013, defeated Australian Thanasi Kokkinakis 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7/2), 6-4 as the 29th seed moved towards a potential third round classic against Djokovic.\n\nAustralia\xe2\x80\x99s Bernard Tomic said he had lost his \xe2\x80\x98respect\xe2\x80\x99 for tennis following his lacklustre 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 loss to Mischa Zverev.\n\nGael Monfils, the flamboyant French 15th seed, crushed German qualifier Daniel Brands 6-3, 7-5, 6-4.\n\nIn the women\xe2\x80\x99s draw, former French Open champion Garbine Muguruza, the 14th seed, defeated Russia\xe2\x80\x99s Ekaterina Alexandrova 6-2, 6-4.\n\nAustralian qualifier Arina Rodionova, ranked 166th, saved seven match points before defeating Russian 16th seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 3-6, 7-6 (8/6), 9-7.'
