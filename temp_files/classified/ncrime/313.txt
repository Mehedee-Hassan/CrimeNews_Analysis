b'Messi commits to Barcelona until 2021..Messi commits to Barcelona until 2021.\nLionel Messi\n\nLionel Messi has agreed to stay at FC Barcelona until 2021 in a deal that all but commits the star striker to playing out the rest of his top-flight career at the Spanish giants.\n\nThe megastar who joined Barcelona as a teenager 17 years ago will remain at the club until he is 34 under the new deal, the Catalan club announced Wednesday, ending months of speculation about the future of the five-time Ballon d\xe2\x80\x99Or winner.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The deal will be signed in the coming weeks, when Messi returns to the team for pre-season training,\xe2\x80\x99 the club said in a statement, as the 30-year-old enjoyed his honeymoon just days after he wed his childhood sweetheart in Argentina.\n\nMessi has hinted in the past that he would like to return in the future to Argentina to play for his very first club, CA Newell\xe2\x80\x99s Old Boys in his hometown of Rosario, where he wed last week. But he has also said that his priority is to win more honours with Barca, the club he has called his home since he was 13.\n\nNo financial details of Messi\xe2\x80\x99s new contact were disclosed, but Spain\xe2\x80\x99s Marca sports daily reported on Tuesday that the deal included a 300-million-euro ($340-million) termination clause.\n\nUnder his current contract, due to run out in June 2018, Messi earns around 20 million euros a year in salary, according to Spanish media -- and this didn\xe2\x80\x99t include millions of euros in revenues earned from ads and performance-linked bonuses.\n\nMessi joined FC Barcelona in 2000 when he was just 13 years old in the youth training centre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98He made his first team debut at just 16 years of age in a friendly against FC Porto, before making his debut the following season against Espanyol at 17,\xe2\x80\x99 the club said in a statement.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Shortly after, he scored his first senior goal with a clever lob against Albacete at the Camp Nou.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nThe deal announcement is likely to reassure fans and members of FC Barcelona, which has had a disappointing season by the club\xe2\x80\x99s own high standards.\n\nThe club was eliminated from the Champions League in the quarter finals by Juventus, and came second behind arch-rivals Real Madrid in La Liga, though Barca did win the Copa del Rey.\n\nMessi\xe2\x80\x99s contract extension consolidates the much-feared \xe2\x80\x98MSN\xe2\x80\x99 striking trio which also includes Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s Neymar and Uruguay\xe2\x80\x99s Luis Suarez.\n\nBoth have also renewed their contracts until 2021.\n\nWith 507 goals scored in 583 official matches, Messi is the club\xe2\x80\x99s all-time leading scorer and is widely considered the world\xe2\x80\x99s best player along with Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo, his Real Madrid rival.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s the best player I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen on the pitch,\xe2\x80\x99 said Ernesto Valverde, Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s new coach, of Messi.\n\nNow 30, Messi could have been tempted by other horizons -- having been courted by clubs like PSG and Manchester City -- particularly as he was found guilty last year of tax fraud in Spain.\n\nBut he has lived in Catalonia since his early teens, and currently resides in Barcelona with his now-wife Antonella Roccuzzo, their son Thiago, four, and Mateo, one -- both of whom were born in Spain.\n\nAnd Messi himself said in May that his aim as a footballer was to \xe2\x80\x98try and win the most titles possible\xe2\x80\x99 with FC Barcelona.'
