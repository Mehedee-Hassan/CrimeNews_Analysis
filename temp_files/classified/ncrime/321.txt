b'King of discus defies age..King of discus defies age.\nAzharul Islam Khan\n\nWhen another medal winning opportunity is knocking the door, Azharul Islam Khan, a 46-year old athlete, is keen to add more accolades in his 24-year long colourful career.\n\nEven though he is yet to receive any formal recognition for his consistence performances and innumerable success, Azharul has already established himself as the undisputed king of discus throw with 31 gold medals in the international and local meets.\n\nAzharul, who brought only medal for the country in the field event of 2010 South Asian Games after managing bronze in discus throw, said he is now preparing for the forthcoming Summer Meet, scheduled on July 21-11, to taste his 32nd gold medal.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I feel excited when I get an opportunity to win another gold medal,\xe2\x80\x99 Azharul told New Age.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I spent most of my life in sports. It\xe2\x80\x99s my passion and obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s my livelihood.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Only because of sports I got some financial comfort in my life and some honour from my neighbours.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nNot only in discus throw, the man hailed from Kishorganj also showed his skill in the shot put and weightlifting events.\n\nHe managed six gold medals in shot put while won four gold medals with two national records in junior weightlifting in his early age.\n\nHowever, Azharul preferred to continue only discus throw even though he had a bright prospect in other two disciplines and made himself unsung hero in the field events.\n\nAzharul joined Bangladesh Army as soldier back in 1989 and started his playing career in 1993 as a boxer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98In my debut year I managed two gold medals in the Inter-Unit Championship,\xe2\x80\x99 Azharul recalled his early days as an athlete.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98At the same time I had a huge interest in discus throw and shot put events. Once my coach, Captain Habib sir told me to leave boxing to give more concentration on discus throw.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nAzharul made his first appearance in the national level in 1995 when he won bronze medal in discus throw. Next year he improved his performance to win silver and in 1997 he tasted his first gold medal in this event.\n\nHe won gold medals in national level every year from 1997 to 2016 except 2012 and 2013.\n\nIn 2012, he was in UN peacekeeping mission in Congo while he missed the gold medal to Mamun Miah in 2013 Bangladesh Games due to lack of preparation just after coming from Africa.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I lost to Mamun only one time in my career,\xe2\x80\x99 said Azharul, who joined Bangladesh Navy on contractual basis in 2014, one year after his retirement from the Bangladesh Army.\n\nAzharul, who broke the national record of Saidur Rub in 2005, broke his own record twice in 2006 and 2010.\n\nAzharul claimed his best achievement came in 2010 when he brought bronze medal for the country in Dhaka SA Games despite receiving very little help from organisers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98When the sprinters got almost one-year training opportunity before the 2010 SA Games, the federation gave me only four-months to prepare myself,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98If I could get more time, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I could battle for the gold medal.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nAzharul, who also have two Indo-Bangla Games gold medals in his showcase, covered 44.98metre in SA Games to manage the bronze medal while Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s Basarat Ali grabbed the gold covering 52.43metre and Simranjeet Singh of India won silver.\n\nDespite the profound passion in the sports Azharul lamented that lack of recognition from government or federation often hurt him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98When I saw many persons with lot less accomplished than myself somehow got selected for the national awards, I became really disappointed,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Nobody praised me for my huge achievement and I have been never nominated for an award, which is my only dissatisfaction. Otherwise I\xe2\x80\x99m a happy person.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nThe veteran athlete, who installed a body-building club in his own village in Kishorganj to nurture young talents, wanted to continue his playing career for another three to four years.'
