But later it opted for a go-slow policy on the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the revenue board on January 27 issued a public notice aimed at removing the confusion about package VAT.\n\nIn the notice, the NBR said that small traders having annual turnover up to Tk 30 lakh were kept out of the purview of the VAT in the new law while all small traders having annual turnover up to Tk 7 lakh are to pay package VAT under the existing law.\n\nSo, small traders will not be affected in the new VAT regime, rather they will enjoy VAT exemption, it said.\n\nIn addition, VAT is paid by consumers, not traders, said the revenue board.\n\nMore about:'
