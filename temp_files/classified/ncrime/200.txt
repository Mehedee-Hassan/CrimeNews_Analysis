When I take a decision I move on with it. I got an incredible amount of practice on grass. Now Wimbledon is coming around you want to feel your best and play your best.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I just have to focus on my first round and take it from there. If I go deep I think it could be very beneficial that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t play clay at all.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nWith Federer\xe2\x80\x99s game motoring along nicely, the 18-time Grand Slam champion is favoured by the bookmakers to win Wimbledon for the first time since 2012.\n\nThat would move the Swiss star past Pete Sampras and William Renshaw into sole possession of first place in the list of male Wimbledon champions.\n\nFederer\xe2\x80\x99s charge towards another historic milestone could be helped by Andy Murray\xe2\x80\x99s hip injury, which prompted the reigning Wimbledon champion to withdraw from two exhibition matches this week and sparked fears about the world number one\xe2\x80\x99s readiness to defend the title.\n\nNovak Djokovic, three times a Wimbledon winner, is enduring a crisis of confidence after the worst run of his career, while French Open champion Rafael Nadal hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been past the fourth round at the All England Club since 2011.\n\nAmerican legend John McEnroe won Wimbledon three times and he agrees with the odds-makers that Federer is in pole position to hoist the trophy on July 16.\n\nFederer is happy to have McEnroe\xe2\x80\x99s support, but he insisted the threat from Murray, Djokovic and Nadal is still strong.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s nice John thinks highly of me this season, but does it get me a couple of free rounds or maybe some big points?\xe2\x80\x99 Federer said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Look, Australia went well, so did the hard courts in general and now last week in Halle.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m healthy, so from my side I feel good about my chances but there is such a long way to go.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98There are other guys that feel great right now as well so I know it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a tough one. They will have their chance to win it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I do believe Wimbledon will be won by one of the top contenders. I hope I\xe2\x80\x99m there and if John thinks so that\xe2\x80\x99s even better.\xe2\x80\x99'
