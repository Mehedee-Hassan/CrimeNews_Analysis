b'Mahela cherishes Bangladesh memories..Mahela cherishes Bangladesh memories.\nBangladesh Premier League franchise Kulna Titans coach Mahela Jayawardene (L) gestures during his unveiling while captain Mahmudullah looks on at a city hotel on Wednesday. \xe2\x80\x94 Sourav Losker\n\nFormer Sri Lankan skipper Mahela Jayawardene cherished his Bangladesh memories when he was introduced as the head coach of Bangladesh Premier League franchise Khulna Titans at a city hotel on Wednesday.\n\nJayawardene, one of the most elegant batsmen of his generation, has got some fond memories of Bangladesh that started way back in 1994 when he came here at his first national tour as a 17-year old man with the Sri Lankan \xe2\x80\x98A\xe2\x80\x99 team.\n\nThe stylish right-handed batsman made his debut three years later at home against India in a historic match, where his side made 952-6 in the first innings, the highest team total in a Test innings till date.\n\nJayawardene, who made 66 in that innings, ended his career with more than 25,000 international runs back in 2015 and his team\xe2\x80\x99s biggest achievement during his long 18-year career was also fulfilled on Bangladesh soil.\n\nJayawardene, who saw his side winning the Champions Trophy jointly with India back in 2002, faced the agony of losing four ICC event finals- two World Cups in 2007 and 2011 and two World Twenty20s in 2009 and 2012.\n\nBut at last he tasted a trophy exclusively in an ICC event in Sri Lankan shirt when his side beat India in the final of World Twenty in 2014 at Dhaka.\n\nJayawardene, who is still the highest run-getter in World Twenty20s with 1016 runs, seemed nostalgic while sharing those fond memories.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Bangladesh obviously has been very close to my heart because my first national tour was in 1994 with Sri Lanka A team that came to Bangladesh. And it was my first break. Since then I have visited Bangladesh quite a few times,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jayawardene, who retired from international cricket after his side made an exit from quarter-final in the World Cup 2015.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We have good memories winning the World Cup and it felt like home when we played against India in here,\xe2\x80\x99 added the Sri Lankan, who played in some Twenty20 tournaments in different countries before he finally hung up bat in February this year.\n\nHe took a coaching job after that and got instant success as he coached Mumbai Indians to help them lift the Indian Premier League title this year.\n\nJayawardene took part as a player in the last edition of BPL to help his erstwhile side Dhaka Dynamites clinch the title and was happy to come back in the tournament with new responsibility of a different franchise.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98This is a great opportunity for me to be part of Khulna, to coach the young team, exciting team, to work with Riyad [Mahmudullah] who obviously had a great season and every year he seems to improve and looking forward to that opportunity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We have signed some exciting cricketers, foreign players this year. And I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to the challenge this year and everyone goes into the tournament wanting to win.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nJayawardene was very impressed with the recent successes of Bangladesh national team and anticipated that its future would be even brighter with an improved system.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I think there is a huge rise for sure. Bangladesh made their start against Sri Lanka so many years back and I was playing on that time. I remembered the World Cup 1999, all these guys plays played in cold English condition and since then Bangladesh has come a long way,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98They have been very consistent for the last six years or so. Purely because, they have a very good talented group of players playing together for a long time and now they understand their roles and playing for each other that is great. And the younger talents that are coming through the system seem to be very consistent,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Lankan.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The biggest secret probably is to have Sri Lankan coaching staff that makes a huge difference, taking a bit of credit for that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jayawardene, also referred as Mahela in his close circle.\n\nHe did not rule out coming here as the coach of national team in future.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Coaching for me is not a job. For me, It\xe2\x80\x99s a challenge personally and at the same time I get to give back to the game that I love whether it is Bangladesh, England, Sri Lanka or wherever I travelled,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.'
