You will have the opportunity to directly have a say in the review and your feedback will be considered by the department,\xe2\x80\x99 Assistant Immigration Minister Alex Hawke said at a Chinese in Australia seminar in Sydney.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98...The expectation from the Australian community is that migrants have competent English,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that is unfair.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nAustralia has seen the rise of nationalist, anti-immigration politics with far-right wing parties such as One Nation garnering strong public support, while the popularity of prime minister Malcolm Turnbull\xe2\x80\x99s ruling centre-right government has been languishing.\n\nMany Chinese millionaires seek to move to Australia for a better lifestyle, although some may also seek to avoid a sweeping corruption crackdown in China that is prompting many wealthy Chinese to move their money.\n\nAustralia tightened SIV rules in 2015 requiring applicants to invest in small-cap and venture capital funds while barring them from direct property investment \xe2\x80\x93 a move that many immigration lawyers say has led to fading appeal for the visa.\n\nHawke emphasised the government was committed to the programme, responding to a question about rumours in China that Australia was looking to scrap the visa.\n\nImmigration is a sensitive issue in Australia which maintains a strict policy of not allowing asylum seekers who try to reach the country by boat to settle there, instead detaining them in controversial camps on Nauru and in Papua New Guinea.\n\nMore about: Australia\n\nimmigration'
