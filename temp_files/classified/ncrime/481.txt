b'Young sculptors are doing good..Young sculptors are doing good.\nHamiduzzaman Khan\n\nInternationally acclaimed artist Hamiduzzaman Khan said the rising demand for sculptures in various sectors, including urban households, has created scopes for sculptors in the country.\n\nMany young talented artists are entering the field as it offers good employment opportunities, said Hamiduzzaman Khan, a former teacher of sculpture department of Dhaka University.\n\nIn an interview with New Age Hamiduzzaman also talked about prospects of the sector, display of sculptures at public places and his personal experiences as an artist.\n\nIn a career spanning more than four decades eminent sculptor Hamiduzzaman Khan has created more than 150 sculptures at both home and abroad. He was invited as the only artist from Bangladesh to participate in the Seoul Olympic Sculpture Park in 1988.\n\nHamiduzzaman Khan said the rising demand for sculptures has created new scopes for artists in the field. \xe2\x80\x98These days the demand for sculptures as home decor items has been growing among the urban community. Besides sculptors are also being sought out by the TV and animation industry as set designers, model makers at animation studios and so on. Besides, many different government and private organisations are hiring sculptors to build sculptures, murals and other structures,\xe2\x80\x99 said Hamiduzzaman Khan.\n\nThanks to the growing prospect of the sector many young and talented artists are coming to the profession, he added.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The young artists are doing well thanks to internet and web-based knowledge platforms which helps them to stay updated. When we were young, we did not such advantage,\xe2\x80\x99 Hamiduzzaman Khan said.\n\nThe artist, who has created numerous sculptures in Bangladesh including Shongshoptok at Jahangirnagar University, Peace Bird at Dhaka University, Bejoyghata at Mymensingh Cantonment, and others, said proper planning is necessary when it comes to setting up of sculptures at public places.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98A sculpture is a permanent work of art which is very expensive to begin with. When it comes to setting up a sculpture at a public location the authorities must plan properly by considering a number of things including the suitability of the sculpture at that specific place, area of expertise of the artist, mentality of the local people and urban landscape surrounding the site so that the sculpture can fulfill its purpose after its completion,\xe2\x80\x99 said Hamiduzzaman, who also observed that unfortunately proper procedures are not followed nowadays by the authorities.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98As a standard procedure, the government asks artists to submit designs and forms a committee to select the best design by evaluating the entries. But, now-a-days, I have been seeing sculptures being set up in the capital city without any open call for submission of designs,\xe2\x80\x99 said Hamiduzzaman.'
