His camp had predicted a \xe2\x80\x98short and sweet\xe2\x80\x99 win over Horn, a 2012 Australian Olympian.\n\nBut Horn showed no signs of being overawed by the occasion, relentlessly taking the fight to the Filipino great and not allowing him to find any rhythm.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I feel like he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a hold of my gap. I was feinting a lot, trying to upset his rhythm and I think that was working throughout the majority of that fight,\xe2\x80\x99 said Horn, who stands three-and-a-half inches (nine cm) taller than Pacquiao.\n\nPacquiao did manage to land some left jabs in the opening rounds to take the early points, but Horn refused to back away and his brawling tactics paid dividends through the middle stages.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98He was quick when he put combinations together but I felt controlling the gap made it easier to see the punches coming,\xe2\x80\x99 Horn said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The size difference helped too.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nPacquiao, bleeding profusely from cuts high above both eyes caused by accidental head clashes, launched a savage counter-attack in the ninth round and appeared to have Horn in trouble with some massive blows that left the Australian staggering.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The ref came over (at the end of the round) and said \xe2\x80\x98show me something or I\xe2\x80\x99ll stop the fight\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x99 Horn said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought, \xe2\x80\x98Hang on, hold your horses -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not that bad, I can keep going for sure\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nHorn recovered and came out strongly in the 10th. \xe2\x80\x98That was just my heart that kept me going,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98He got me with a couple of good shots and I did go backwards more in that round than in any other round in the fight, but I still felt good.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98But I came back in the 10th, 11th and 12th.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nBoth fighters began to tire in the final stages of a contest fought at a breakneck pace, but Horn\xe2\x80\x99s early lead proved too much to peg back as he claimed the biggest win of his career.\n\nPacquiao had been hoping to set up a second big-money showdown with Floyd Mayweather, but it was Horn who called for a fight with the unbeaten American immediately after his win.\n\nPacquiao\xe2\x80\x99s strength and conditioning coach Justin Fortune was left fuming by the result, claiming: \xe2\x80\x98The referee was sketchy, the judges were crazy.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Manny lost the fight, but Jeff Horn looks like a pumpkin,\xe2\x80\x99 added Fortune, referring to the badly swollen face of Horn, who needed stitches over his right eye.\n\nLewis, the former undisputed world heavyweight champion, tweeted: \xe2\x80\x98This is what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with boxing. Horn was very game but I\xe2\x80\x99m hard pressed to see how he could have won that fight by any stretch!\xe2\x80\x99'
