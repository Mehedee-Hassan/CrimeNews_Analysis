Playing four birdies against a single bogey on that course was not bad I think.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I am just one shot behind the top golfers and still long way to go. So I\xe2\x80\x99m very much confident to win the race,\xe2\x80\x99 he added.\n\nSamarth, playing only his second season as a professional, got off to a disastrous start with bogeys on the first two holes but the 24-year-old from Allahabad regained his confidence with a 10-feet birdie conversion on the seventh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve not had the ideal start to the season having missed the cut in three out of four events so far. But I feel I\xe2\x80\x99m now driving better with my new driver which I began using last week.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nBangladesh\xe2\x80\x99s Mohammad Ripon struck an eagle in the 10th hole to keep himself on the 10th position with two other Indians with two-under-par 70, just one short of Siddik .\n\nBut another prominent Bangladeshi golfer Jamal Hossain Mollah had a bad day as he finished with five-over-par 77 to be placed in 65th spot though 18 other local players, who all are now in danger of missing the cut.\n\nThe tournament is the second Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI) sanctioned tournament in Bangladesh this year after the BTI Open, held in Dhaka earlier this month.\n\nWinner of that event, Udayan Mane finished on 41st with two-over par 74.\n\nMore about:'
