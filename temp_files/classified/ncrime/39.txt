b'Anti-Trump protests continue..Anti-Trump protests continue.\nSeveral hundred protesters are arrested by Los Angeles police after a march and rally in protest at the election of Republican Donald Trump as President of the United States in Los Angeles, California on Saturday. \xe2\x80\x94 Reuters photo\n\nTrump weighs cabinet picks and \xe2\x80\x98amended\xe2\x80\x99 Obamacare\n\nDonald Trump is to huddle Saturday with his White House transition team for a second day over cabinet picks as the president-elect says he is open to keeping parts of president Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s signature healthcare law.\n\nThe billionaire real estate mogul said in interviews that he would consider an \xe2\x80\x98amended\xe2\x80\x99 version of the 2010 health law, a shift in position after vowing on the campaign trail to repeal the measure.\n\nThe announcement was one of several surprises, as Trump shook up his transition team by putting running mate Mike Pence in charge and named a cohort of Washington insiders \xe2\x80\x93 and three of his children \xe2\x80\x93 to help with the process of choosing a new cabinet.\n\nThe reshuffle came as anti-Trump protesters spilled onto the streets for a third straight night, with the Republican facing mounting calls to reassure Americans who fear a xenophobic crackdown under his authority.\n\nThrongs of people \xe2\x80\x93 among them families and children \xe2\x80\x93 rallied late Friday in New York\xe2\x80\x99s Washington Square carrying banners reading \xe2\x80\x98Peace and Love\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Your wall can\xe2\x80\x99t stand in our way.\xe2\x80\x99 Local media estimated a turnout of some 4,000 protesters.\n\nIn Portland, Oregon, a demonstrator was shot and sustained non-life-threatening injuries after what police believe was a confrontation. The suspect then fled the area.\n\nAnd more than 1,000 people gathered in Miami, with weekend protests planned in a number of other cities.\n\nA focal point for New York protests is Trump Tower, where the real estate tycoon-turned-world-leader has been ensconced in his luxury apartment, mapping out his next steps.\n\nThe 70-year-old incoming president has a mammoth task of fleshing out his cabinet, as well as steering the complex transition of power, and announced on Friday he was elevating vice president-elect Pence to lead the process.\n\nTrump included three of his children and his son-in-law Jared Kushner on the transition team \xe2\x80\x93 a move likely to raise eyebrows, since the tycoon earlier announced that should he win he would place his vast business interests into a blind trust operated by Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump.\n\nAnd in a clear shift from his abrasive campaign, he added to his transition team a string of insider figures from the very establishment that he railed against so strongly, including Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus \xe2\x80\x93 now tipped as a possible chief of staff.\n\nTrump took his first steps toward engaging with Washington on Thursday when he met with Barack Obama at the White House to discuss the transition ahead of the January 20 inauguration \xe2\x80\x93 a conversation the outgoing president called \xe2\x80\x98excellent.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nThe Oval Office meeting appears to have nudged Trump towards a compromise on his oft-repeated threat to repeal Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Affordable Care Act.\n\nTrump told The Wall Street Journal the president asked him to consider preserving parts of the healthcare law \xe2\x80\x93 and that he was open to the idea.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Either Obamacare will be amended, or repealed and replaced,\xe2\x80\x99 Trump told the newspaper. \xe2\x80\x98I told him I will look at his suggestions, and out of respect, I will do that.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nAccording to The Journal, Trump said he favoured maintaining a prohibition on insurance companies denying coverage because of so-called pre-existing conditions. Before the law took effect, insurers had been able to refuse to cover people who had previously suffered almost any illness.\n\nTrump also said he was not opposed to requiring insurers to allow children to remain on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 insurance policies until the age of 26, a key Obamacare tenet.\n\nOn the Syrian conflict, however, Trump indicated a possible sharp shift away from Obama administration policy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve had an opposite view of many people regarding Syria,\xe2\x80\x99 he told the paper, suggesting a closer focus on fighting the Islamic State group \xe2\x80\x93 and arguing that in seeking to oust president Bashar al-Assad, \xe2\x80\x98we end up fighting Russia,\xe2\x80\x99 the regime\xe2\x80\x99s ally.\n\nTrump has already spoken with a string of world leaders including British prime minister Theresa May and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with whom he reaffirmed Washington\xe2\x80\x99s strong relations.\n\nThe apparently harmonious meeting between Trump and Obama was designed to heal divisions and quell fears about the health of the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading democracy.\n\nMeanwhile, in an interview to be aired on Sunday, Trump showed a rare softer side, speaking warmly of the election night call he received from Hillary Clinton conceding that he had won.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98It was a lovely call, and it was a tough call for her \xe2\x80\x93 I mean, I can imagine,\xe2\x80\x99 he said in the interview, excerpts of which were aired Friday.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean, for me, it would have been very, very difficult. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been nicer. She just said, \xe2\x80\x98Congratulations, Donald, well done.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nAnd I said, \xe2\x80\x98I want to thank you very much, you were a great competitor,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, praising his vanquished political foe as \xe2\x80\x98very strong and very smart.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nHe also spoke about a call he received from her husband, former president Bill Clinton, who he said \xe2\x80\x98couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been more gracious.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nTrump said he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out approaching the former US leader for advice.'
