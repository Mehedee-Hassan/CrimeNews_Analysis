b'Bolt fires to 100m victory in Ostrava..Bolt fires to 100m victory in Ostrava.\nJamaican sprint king Usain Bolt (C) finishes the touchline to win the men\xe2\x80\x99s 100-metre sprint at the Golden Spike athletic meeting in Ostrava, Czech Republic on Wednesday. \xe2\x80\x94 AP photo\n\nJamaican sprint superstar Usain Bolt overcame a stiff back to fire to victory in the 100m in Ostrava on Wednesday in a modest 10.06 seconds, in what was his first appearance in Europe in his farewell season.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I love this crowd\xe2\x80\x99s high energy. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I come back here. I love you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bolt, in his ninth appearance in the northeastern Czech city.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not happy with the time, but I\xe2\x80\x99m getting into it.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nBolt, winner of eight Olympic and 11 world gold medals, will bring\n\ndown the curtain on his glittering career at August\xe2\x80\x99s world championships in London.\n\nHe again proved to have not lost any of his showman\xe2\x80\x99s charisma as he played to the sell-out 15,000-capacity crowd at the Mestsky Stadium when introduced in hot, humid weather.\n\nThe field was a kind one for Bolt, only Jak Ali Harvey, previously of Jamaica but now representing Turkey, having gone below 10sec.\n\nStarting in lane five, Bolt was somewhat tardy in getting up and out\n\nof the blocks, the 100 and 200m world record holder easily matched by Cuban Yunier Perez outside him over the opening half of the race.\n\nAs the crowd roared, so Bolt responded as he has so many times before,\n\nmoving into his famed \xe2\x80\x98drive phase\xe2\x80\x99, head coming slowly up as part of the process that unleashes the full power from his long legs.\n\nFor a flash moment, Perez looked like he might have had the better of the towering Jamaican, but it was not to be as Bolt powered home with a knowing look across to the Cuban from 20 metres out.\n\nBolt ripped through\n\nthe finish line, eyes glued on the stadium\xe2\x80\x99s big screen at the end of the 100m track.\n\nPerez came in second in a personal best of 10.09sec, with Bolt\xe2\x80\x99s winning time far off his world record of 9.58sec, set back at the Berlin world championships in 2009.\n\nBolt said his programme would now include more training as well as a trip to his doctor in Germany.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s just my back, as always. It\xe2\x80\x99s always an issue,\xe2\x80\x99 said the 30-year-old, shortly before doing two long jumps before the remaining crowd and media.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98My doctor told me over the years that the older I get, the worse it\xe2\x80\x99s going to get, so I just have to really try to keep in check which is why I need to go and see him to make sure everything\xe2\x80\x99s smooth because it feels a little bit tight, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get injured so that\xe2\x80\x99s a key thing, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy about that.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nThe Jamaican has consistently been a beacon for clean athletes amid\n\ndoping and corruption scandals that mired Sebastian Coe\xe2\x80\x99s first couple of years in office as IAAF president.\n\nHis absence from the sport will leave a void that will be tough to fill, as shown by the hero\xe2\x80\x99s send-off he was afforded by the Ostrava crowd after the Jamaican anthem was played.'
