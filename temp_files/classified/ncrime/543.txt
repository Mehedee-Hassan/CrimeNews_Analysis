b'Farm loan release crosses annual target in 11 months..Farm loan release crosses annual target in 11 months.\nCountry\xe2\x80\x99s banks crossed their annual target of farm loan disbursement in 11 months (July-May) of this fiscal year against a backdrop of a decreased credit demand from the industrial sector that forced them to disburse loans more to farmers at an interest rate of 10 per cent.\n\nBesides, the interest rates on consumer loans offered by the banks have recently dropped to the range of 8 per cent to 11 per cent because of dull business situation in the country that has made the banks focus on the farm loan disbursement.\n\nThe banks distributed Tk 18,935.57 crore in farm loans in the July-May period of FY 2016-17, which is 107.89 per cent of their annual farm loan disbursement target of Tk 17,550 crore, according to the latest Bangladesh Bank data.\n\nThe banks have been lowering the interest rates for their almost all products in recent times as they are grappling with surplus liquidity amid dull business situation in the country, a BB official told New Age on Thursday.\n\nThe BB data showed that farm loan disbursement also posted a 22.62-per cent growth in the 11 months of this fiscal year compared with that in the same period of FY16.\n\nThe BB official said that the banks earlier used to invest their idle money in the treasury bills and bonds, but the scope had recently been squeezed.\n\nThe government postponed all auctions for T-bills and bonds in March and May and it conducted limited auctions in February and April, he said.\n\nA huge amount of the net investment in the national savings tools in recent months has forced the government to shelve the auctions for T-bills and bonds, he said.\n\nAgainst the backdrop, the banks are trying to increase their farm loan disbursement to use their excess liquidity.\n\nDue to a declining trend in weighted average rate for both lending and deposit products offered by the banks, the central bank on Thursday cut the interest rate on farm loans to 9 per cent from 10 per cent.\n\nThe latest initiative taken by the central bank would encourage farmers to get farm loans from banks at a decreased rate.\n\nIn July-May of FY17, the eight state-owned commercial and specialised banks \xe2\x80\x94 Sonali, Janata, Agrani, Rupali, BASIC, BDBL, Bangladesh Krishi Bank and Rajshahi Krishi Unnayan Bank \xe2\x80\x94 together disbursed Tk 9,139.89 crore in agriculture loans. The amount is 98.38 per cent of their annual farm loan disbursement target of Tk 9,290 crore.\n\nThe private and foreign commercial banks together disbursed Tk 9,795.68 crore in agriculture loans in the 11 months of FY17. The amount is 118.59 per cent of their annual farm loan disbursement target of Tk 8,260 crore.\n\nMore about: banking\n\nfarmer'
