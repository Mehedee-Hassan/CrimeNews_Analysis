Washington sees excess global production capacity, particularly in China, administration officials say.\n\nAnd on Sunday a US warship sailed near a disputed island in the South China Sea claimed by China, drawing a rebuke from the Chinese ministry of foreign affairs.\n\nTrump, who held talks with Abe earlier this year at the president\xe2\x80\x99s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, has forged a united front with the Japanese leader on the need to exert pressure on North Korea to curb its nuclear and missile development.'
