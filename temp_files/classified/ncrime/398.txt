Ours is being built,\xe2\x80\x99 Florian Philippot, a senior figure in France's National Front (FN), tweeted. Jean-Marie Le Pen, the founder of the party and father of its leader Marine, said: \xe2\x80\x98Today the United States, tomorrow France!\xe2\x80\x99\n\nBeatrix von Storch, deputy leader of the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, said: \xe2\x80\x98Donald Trump's victory is a sign that citizens of the western world want a clear change in policy.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nDuring the US election campaign, Trump expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, questioned central tenets of the NATO military alliance and suggested that Japan and South Korea should be allowed to develop nuclear weapons to shoulder their own defence burden.\n\nHe has vowed to undo a global deal on climate change struck by world powers in Paris last year and renegotiate the deal between Tehran and the West which eased sanctions against the Islamic Republic in exchange for allowing close monitoring of its nuclear programme.\n\nBut many western governments are unsure whether Trump, a real estate mogul and former reality TV star with no government experience, will follow through on his campaign pledges, some of which would turn the post-war order on its head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We're realising now that we have no idea what this American president will do if the voice of anger enters office and the voice of anger becomes the most powerful man in the world,\xe2\x80\x99 Norbert Roettgen, a conservative ally of Merkel and head of the German parliament's foreign affairs committee, told German radio. \xe2\x80\x98Geopolitically we are in a very uncertain situation.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nProminent historian Simon Schama described a Trump victory and Republican control of both the Senate and US House of Representatives as a \xe2\x80\x98genuinely frightening prospect\xe2\x80\x99.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98NATO will be under pressure to disintegrate, the Russians will make trouble, 20 million people will lose their health insurance, climate change (policies) will be reversed, bank regulation will be liquidated. Do you want me to go on?,\xe2\x80\x99 Schama told the BBC.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course it's not Hitler. There are many varieties of fascism. I didn't say he was a Nazi although neo-Nazis are celebrating.\xe2\x80\x99"
