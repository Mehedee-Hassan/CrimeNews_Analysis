Senior players were counseled on who should succeed Cook and were unanimous in suggesting Root. \xe2\x80\x98Yes (England coach) Trevor Bayliss spoke to me and others,\xe2\x80\x99 said seamer Stuart Broad on Skysports on Tuesday.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Joe was the natural successor to Alastair. He has learnt his game at the top level and will thrive on the extra responsibility.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nRoot is less experienced than any of his 79 predecessors in the job, however, and Thursday will only be the fifth time he has captained a first-class side.\n\nHe takes over a team humiliated 4-0 last winter by India and looking to use a seven-Test summer -- a three-match series against West Indies follows South Africa -- to build towards an Ashes winter.\n\nBesides winning both this summer\xe2\x80\x99s series, Root will be desperate to ensure that he continues to score the runs that have been his hallmark since bursting into the team in 2012. In five years, no batsman has scored more than his 4,594 Test runs and only India captain Virat Kohli betters him in all forms of the international game.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98What will make Joe\xe2\x80\x99s life easiest of all is if he\xe2\x80\x99s doing well himself,\xe2\x80\x99 wrote former England captain Nasser Hussain in the Daily Mail. \xe2\x80\x98My first England coach Duncan Fletcher used to tell the press when I was struggling that I was one of the team\xe2\x80\x99s all-rounders. I knew it was rubbish.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nRoot looks set to move himself one place down the order to four, with Ballance in at three. Cook remains in the team as opener, while Middlesex seamer Toby Roland-Jones looks likely to make his debut on his home ground in the absence of the injured Chris Woakes and Jake Ball. Spinner Liam Dawson is another option in the 12.\n\nAlthough South Africa are ranked two places above England at two in the world, they have been depleted by the loss of captain Faf du Plessis, who has stayed at home to be with his wife after the birth of their first child. Dean Elgar takes over as skipper.'
