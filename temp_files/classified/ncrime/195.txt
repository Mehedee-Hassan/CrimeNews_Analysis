A peace deal in 2007 ultimately brought key rebel leaders into the administration, but deep divisions remained.\n\nThe country again came close to civil war in 2011 when then-leader Laurent Gbagbo refused to concede defeat after losing the election and some 3,000 people were killed in the violence that followed. Current President Alassane Ouattara was later installed with the help of his former rebel allies and the international community.\n\nSome 6,900 uniformed personnel were authorized under the original UN resolution authorizing the peacekeeping mission, but that number had fallen to roughly 2,600 at the end of last year.\n\nAs of Friday, the mission that most recently cost $153 million a year will be over. The UN Security Council in April 2016 voted unanimously to end the mission, a motion of confidence in the country\xe2\x80\x99s progress.\n\nFor many Ivorians, the departure of the peacekeepers is a positive sign even as worries flare about the recent military tensions. Many recall it was only six years ago that post-electoral conflict claimed so many lives.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The UN mission should stay in place a few more years during the process of reconciliation and restructuring the army,\xe2\x80\x99 said Firmin Kouakou, a student in the financial capital, Abidjan. \xe2\x80\x98The seeds that led to the previous crisis are gradually re-emerging.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nGbagbo, the former president, is still awaiting trial on war crimes charges at The Hague along with his ally Charles Ble Goude, and critics have accused Ouattara\xe2\x80\x99s administration of prioritizing the human rights abuses perpetrated on his supporters.\n\nWhile the last election in 2015 was peaceful and saw the incumbent re-elected, Ouattara is constitutionally barred from running again. Observers say that vacuum could create more uncertainty about the country\xe2\x80\x99s political future.\n\nDisgruntled soldiers have launched a series of mutinies in recent months, paralyzing commerce and raising concerns about further unrest. The recent discovery of an enormous cache of weapons in the former rebel stronghold of Bouake has created even more alarm in a country with a long history of conflict. Authorities have said they are investigating.\n\nHuman rights groups are urging the government to do more as the UN mission departs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The vast majority of the commanders and leaders implicated in a decade of serious human rights violations - on both sides of the military-political divide - have not been held to account,\xe2\x80\x99 said a statement released Friday by Human Rights Watch and others.\n\nDrissa Traore, the vice president of the International Federation for Human Rights, said that \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to say whether the recovery is sustainable.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nTraore added: \xe2\x80\x98The peace dividends that the United Nations has contributed to could be reversed unless the Ivorian government addresses pervasive immunity and the army\xe2\x80\x99s lack of discipline.\xe2\x80\x99'
