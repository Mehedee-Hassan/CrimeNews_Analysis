b"North Korea : ICBM can carry nuclear warhead..North Korea : ICBM can carry nuclear warhead.\nThis image made from video of a news bulletin aired by North Korea's KRT on Tuesday, July 4, 2017, shows what was said to be the launch of a Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile, ICBM, in North Korea's northwest. \xe2\x80\x94 AP photo\n\nNorth Korea said on Wednesday its newly developed intercontinental ballistic missile can carry a large nuclear warhead, triggering a call by Washington for global action to hold it accountable for pursuing nuclear weapons.\n\nA spokeswoman for the US Defence Department said it had concluded that North Korea test-launched an ICBM on Tuesday, which some experts now believe had the range to reach the US state of Alaska as well as parts of the mainland United States.\n\nUS secretary of state Rex Tillerson said the test, on the eve of the US Independence Day holiday, represented \xe2\x80\x98a new escalation of the threat\xe2\x80\x99 to the United States and its allies, and vowed to take stronger measures.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un said the test completed his country's strategic weapons capability that includes atomic and hydrogen bombs and ICBMs, the state KCNA news agency said.\n\nPyongyang would not negotiate with the United States to give up those weapons until Washington abandons its hostile policy against the North, KCNA quoted Kim as saying.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98He, with a broad smile on his face, told officials, scientists and technicians that the US would be displeased ... as it was given a 'package of gifts' on its 'Independence Day',\xe2\x80\x99 KCNA said.\n\nKim ordered them to \xe2\x80\x98frequently send big and small 'gift packages' to the Yankees,\xe2\x80\x99 it added.\n\nThe launch came days before leaders from the Group of 20 nations are due to discuss steps to rein in North Korea's weapons programme, which it has pursued in defiance of United Nations Security Council sanctions.\n\nThe test successfully verified the technical requirements of the newly developed ICBM in stage separation, the atmospheric re-entry of the warhead and the late-stage control of the warhead, KCNA said.\n\nTillerson warned that any country that hosts North Korean workers, provides economic or military aid to Pyongyang, or fails to implement UN sanctions \xe2\x80\x98is aiding and abetting a dangerous regime\xe2\x80\x99.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98All nations should publicly demonstrate to North Korea that there are consequences to their pursuit of nuclear weapons,\xe2\x80\x99 Tillerson said in a statement.\n\nUS president Donald Trump has been urging China, North Korea's main trading partner and only big ally, to press Pyongyang to give up its nuclear programme.\n\nThe UN Security Council, currently chaired by China, will hold an emergency meeting on the matter at 3:00pm EDT (1900 GMT) on Wednesday, following a request by the United States, Japan and South Korea.\n\nDiplomats say Beijing has not been fully enforcing existing international sanctions on its neighbour, and has resisted tougher measures, such as an oil embargo, bans on the North Korean airline and guest workers, and measures against Chinese banks and other firms doing business with the North.\n\nA 2015 UN document estimated that more than 50,000 North Korean workers were overseas earning currencies for the regime, with the vast majority in China and Russia.\n\nNorth Korea appeared to have used a Chinese truck, originally sold for hauling timber, but later converted for military use, to transport and erect the missile on Tuesday.\n\nTrump has indicated he is running out of patience with Beijing's efforts to rein in North Korea. His administration has said all options are on the table, military included, but suggested those would be a last resort and that sanctions and diplomatic pressure were its preferred course.\n\nTrump is due to meet Chinese president Xi Jinping and Russian president Vladimir Putin during the G20 meeting in Germany this week.\n\nRussia and China joined diplomatic forces on Tuesday and called for North Korea to suspend its ballistic missile program in return for a moratorium on large-scale military exercises by the United States and South Korea.\n\nThe US and South Korean militaries conducted a ballistic missile test early on Wednesday in a show of force on the east coast of the Korean peninsula. The South said the drill aimed to showcase the ability to strike at the North's leadership if necessary.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98It's discouraging that the Chinese (and Russians) are still calling for 'restraint by all sides', despite the fact that their client state, North Korea, has cast aside all restraint and is sprinting for the finish line in demonstrating a nuclear-armed ICBM capability,\xe2\x80\x99 said Daniel Russel, formerly Washington\xe2\x80\x99s top East Asia diplomat, now a diplomat in residence at the Asia Society Policy Institute.\n\nThe North's state media said the missile, Hwasong-14, flew 933 km (580 miles), reaching an altitude of 2,802 km (1,741 miles) in its 39 minutes of flight.\n\nSome analysts said the flight details suggested the new missile had a range of more than 8,000 km (4,970 miles), which would put significant parts of the US mainland in range, a major advance in the North's programme.\n\nThe launch was both earlier and \xe2\x80\x98far more successful than expected\xe2\x80\x99, said US-based missile expert John Schilling, a contributor to the Washington-based North Korea monitoring project, 38 North.\n\nIt would now probably only be a year or two before a North Korean ICBM achieved \xe2\x80\x98minimal operational capability,\xe2\x80\x99 he added.\n\nExperts say a reliable nuclear-tipped ICBM would require a small warhead to fit a long-range missile, technology to protect against intense heat as it re-enters the atmosphere, separate the warhead and guide it to its target.\n\nSouth Korean president Moon Jae-in, who ordered Wednesday's drill, said, \xe2\x80\x98The situation was no longer sufficient to respond to the North's provocation by making statements,\xe2\x80\x99 according to his office.\n\nTuesday's missile test poses fresh challenges for Moon, who took office in May with a pledge to engage the North in dialogue while keeping up pressure and sanctions to impede its weapons programmes.\n\nHis defence minister, Han Min-koo, told parliament on Wednesday there was a high possibility of a sixth nuclear test by the North, but there were no specific indications."
