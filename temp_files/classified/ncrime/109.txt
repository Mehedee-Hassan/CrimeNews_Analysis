b'Swimming coach being probed..Swimming coach being probed.\nAbdul Hamid\n\nThe Bangladesh Swimming Federation has launched an investigation against national team assistant coach Abdul Hamid after six national swimmers raised certain allegations against him, officials said on Wednesday.\n\nSix national swimmers lodged a complaint to federation president Admiral Mohammad Nizamuddin Ahmed in April and a three-member committee was formed immediately to look into the matter.\n\nHowever, the committee members could start their work only on Wednesday as they were busy with nationwide talent-hunt programme previously, said the federation officials.\n\nSwimmers said they had no choice but to take the issue to the federation president as other officials did not pay any heed to them, despite receiving verbal complaints time-to-time.\n\nMahfuza Khatun Shila, double gold medallist swimmer of last South Asian Games, said that Hamid misbehaved with them on many occasions during the training camp for Islamic Solidarity Games and often left them demoralised with his negative comments.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Whenever we sought his help to solve any problem, he always ignored us. He either pretended to read newspaper or watching television,\xe2\x80\x99 said Shila.\n\nAnother swimmer Nazma Khatun claimed that Hamid always raised question over their ability.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Motivating the swimmer is one of the main jobs of a coach but surprisingly he [Hamid] always tried to demoralise us with his humiliating words,\xe2\x80\x99 Nazma said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Once we told him that the water in the pool was hot and he should take steps to change it. He replied that it was not his problem because he would not swim,\xe2\x80\x99 said Nazma.\n\nSwimmer Jewel Ahmed said Hamid had little concern over the facilities of the swimmers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98He was actually main coordinator of the camp and he also got salary from the Bangladesh Olympic Association as assistant coach during the camp but we never got any help from him,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\nEarlier in 2016 it was alleged that Hamid questioned the ability of Shila before the SA Games in India and claimed to have said she was included in the team only in \xe2\x80\x98freedom fighters\xe2\x80\x99 quota.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x98If other officials had listened to him I would not have won two gold medals in SA Games,\xe2\x80\x99 said Shila.\n\nHamid, who is also a joint secretary of the federation, denied all allegations against him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98These are completely baseless allegations. They [allegations] are part of conspiracy against me,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\nHamid claimed that he was yet to get any formal notice from probe committee.\n\nProbe committee member Selim Miah said they will speak to relevant people within a very short time.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We were busy with the talent-hunt programme earlier.\n\nThis is why we could not investigate the matter so far. But we will now speak to everyone concerned and submit our report in the next meeting of the federation, which could be held on July 11,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.'
