b'Low spoilt for choice with World Cup looming..Low spoilt for choice with World Cup looming.\nAfter Germany\xe2\x80\x99s success at the Confederations Cup and Under 21 European championship over the last few days, coach Joachim Low must feel like a kid in a candy store as he maps out his plans for next year\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup title defence in Russia.\n\nDespite resting more than half a dozen key players this summer, Germany won the Confederations Cup for the first time on Sunday by beating South American champions Chile 1-0.\n\nTwo days earlier, the country\xe2\x80\x99s Under-21 team secured the European title, shocking favourites Spain by the same score and confirming the country\xe2\x80\x99s stellar work at youth level.\n\nThe 57-year-old Low, now in his 11th year in charge, has a pool of more than 40 players to monitor as the clock ticks down to next year\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup finals. All of them battle-tested and with tournament experience.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Joachim Low now has the big chance, with a mix of experience and dynamism, to put together a strong squad (for next year),\xe2\x80\x99 said German Football Association President Reinhard Grindel. \xe2\x80\x98We have a big pool to chose from.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nThe biggest problem for Low is likely to be who to leave out.\n\nPlayers like Confederations Cup top scorers Timo Werner, Lars Stindl and Leon Goretzka, who all netted three times at the tournament, have every right to believe their fine performances in Russia will be a stepping stone to the 2018 World Cup squad.\n\nAntonio Ruediger, Sebastian Rudy and Mathias Ginter also rose to the occasion while Julian Draxler, who captained the team in the absence of Manuel Neuer, was voted player of the tournament.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We certainly have a lot of players who in those two tournaments have filled up on confidence,\xe2\x80\x99 Low said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98But for those players the work is just starting, the big tournaments are still to come. To get to world class level is an even bigger challenge.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nLow has long preached the importance of having two players for every position to be successful at international level.\n\nJudging by performances over the last few days, it appears he may have at least three.\n\nAt the top of the pile are Neuer, Jerome Boateng, Mats Hummels, Toni Kroos, Sami Khedira, Mesut Ozil, Thomas Muller and Marco Reus, who all sat out the tournament to be fit and fresh for the coming year.\n\nInjury kept several other first team players from the Confederations Cup, such as Leroy Sane, Ilkay Guendogan, Julian Weigl and Jonathan Tah.\n\nBut no one can afford to feel their position is secure with the likes of Under-21 players Jeremy Toljan, Niklas Stark, Maximilian Arnold, Max Meyer, Serge Gnabry and Davie Selke pushing for a place in the full squad.\n\nWhile Low was delighted to win both tournaments, he said the World Cup would be an entirely different proposition.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Germany will always be one of the favourites, no matter what tournament,\xe2\x80\x99 Low said. \xe2\x80\x98Winning the Confederations Cup and the Under-21 Euro win are no guarantees.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98At a World Cup there are five, six teams you battle against and everyone must almost be superhuman to succeed.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nMore about:'
