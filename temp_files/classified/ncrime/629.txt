b"Smartphone 'orders' body to treat diabetes..Smartphone 'orders' body to treat diabetes.\nScientists have used a smartphone to control the activity of the living cells inside an animal.\n\nThe fusion of biology and technology was used to control blood sugar levels in mice with diabetes.\n\nThe idea, described in Science Translational Medicine, could be applied to a wide range of diseases and drug treatments.\n\nAnd the Chinese researchers say the approach could pave the way for a \xe2\x80\x98new era\xe2\x80\x99 in medicine.\n\nThe first step was to turn normal cells into living factories.\n\nThey were genetically engineered to manufacture drugs that control blood sugar levels such as insulin - but only in response to light.\n\nThe technology is called optogenetics and these cells would kick into gear when exposed to specific wavelengths of red light.\n\nThen comes the tech - a set of wirelessly powered LEDs and a smartphone app to control them.\n\nResearchers at East China Normal University in Shanghai implanted the system into mice and were able to control diabetes with the tap of a touchscreen.\n\nThe team said the findings \xe2\x80\x98could pave the way for a new era of personalised, digitalised and globalised precision medicine\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nThe scientists needed to take tiny drops of blood to know how high the blood sugar levels were so they could calculate how much drug to release inside the animal.\n\nTheir ultimate goal is a fully automated system that both detects sugar levels and then releases the right amount of therapeutic chemicals.\n\nThis idea is clearly at an early stage, but it is not limited to diabetes. Cells could be engineered to manufacture a wide range of drugs.\n\nProfessor Mark Gomelsky, a molecular biologist from the University of Wyoming, said the study was an \xe2\x80\x98exciting accomplishment\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nHe added: \xe2\x80\x98How soon should we expect to see people on the street wearing fashionable LED wristbands that irradiate implanted cells engineered to produce genetically encoded drugs under the control of a smartphone?\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Not just yet, but the work provides us with an exciting glimpse into the future of smart cell-based therapeutics.\xe2\x80\x99"
