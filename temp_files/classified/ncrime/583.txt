I began my career with the 2002 Games,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mahfuza Khatun Shila, the double gold medal winning swimmer in last year\xe2\x80\x99s South Asian Games,\n\n\xe2\x80\x98In the last edition, I managed five gold medals which I think was a big achievement for me. I was really keen to show my ability in another Games but it was really disappointing for us to know that the Games would not be held this year.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nRabbi Hasan Munna, the gold medallist in 10metre air rifle in last Bangladesh Games, was also eager to make an attempt to regain his medal.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98This was my first and only gold medal in the national level,\xe2\x80\x99 Munna recalled his memory.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98After that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t win any gold in any senior competition. I had a personal target of retaining the Bangladesh Game gold medal because I was now in good form but unfortunately I lost the opportunity,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\nMunna, who managed the silver medal in last month\xe2\x80\x99s Islamic Solidarity Games in his signature event, requested the relevant authorities to hold the Bangladesh Games in every four years.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I want to request the authorities to hold the Games this year because it is the highest Game in our country. Winning gold medal such tournament is a dream for any athlete,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\nFarid Khan Chowdhury, joint secretary of Bangladesh Athletic Federation, claimed the Games boosted the image of the whole country four years ago.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Such meet grows interest among every stakeholder of the sports,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Last time we saw hundreds of athletes and organisations, who spent idle time for the last few years, took part in the meet with great joy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know why the Games wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be held this year.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nBOA claimed they wanted to hold the youth games instead of the senior meet to find out some talented athletes for the future.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We wanted to give an opportunity to those young athletes who were picked up by a nationwide talent hunt programme from grassroots level organised by the National Sports Council last year,\xe2\x80\x99 said BOA deputy secretary general Ashikur Rahman Miku.\n\nLast year National Sports Council successfully organised a nationwide talent hunt programme from the grassroots level with 32 sports federations getting a group of talented Under-16 athletes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98If we hold the senior meet this year then the talented athletes wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a chance to show their potential,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98Considering their future, we wanted to find some genuine talents from the Youth Games.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nBOA wants to start the Youth Games (Under-18) in November with the zonal round while the final round will be held Dhaka in March next year.\n\nThe meet would start from the district level with all the upazillas competing to advance into the divisional level.\n\nThe best athletes of the divisional level would compete in the final round.\n\nMore about:'
