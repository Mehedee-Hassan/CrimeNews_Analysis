These families have lost their homes, belongings and often their sources of income,\xe2\x80\x99 said Christos Stylianides, EU commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98With this new contribution from the EU, emergency support will be provided to those most in need to ensure they have shelters to keep them safe and are better equipped with means to survive this hard time,\xe2\x80\x99 said the EU commissioner.\n\nOut of the total funding, euro 1 million will be dedicated to addressing the urgent humanitarian needs in Bangladesh, where Cyclone Mora has affected the lives of close to three million people, said a press release.\n\nAccording to data made available by the government of Bangladesh, some 52,000 houses have been damaged or destroyed, leaving over 2,00,000 people displaced.\n\nThe worst-hit area is Cox\xe2\x80\x99s Bazar district, in the south-east of the country.\n\nA further euro 5,00,000 will be used to provide emergency humanitarian assistance to cyclone-affected populations in Myanmar, particularly in the northern part of Rakhine State where widespread destruction has been reported.\n\nAccording to the most recent assessments, the cyclone has left close to 50, 000 structures in the area damaged, including more than 21, 000 houses and shelters for internally displaced people, and over 26,000 sanitation facilities.\n\nThe EU funding, which will be channelled through the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations, will support the EU\xe2\x80\x99s humanitarian partners on the ground in implementing emergency relief programmes in cyclone-hit areas.\n\nThe aid will focus on responding to the most pressing needs, which include the provision of emergency shelter and food assistance as well as access to clean water, health care services, sanitation facilities and good hygiene practices.\n\nTropical Cyclone Mora made landfall along the south-eastern coast of Bangladesh on May 30.\n\nIt brought strong winds and heavy downpours that wreaked havoc across large parts of Cox\xe2\x80\x99s Bazar and Chittagong Hill Tracts as well as several areas of Myanmar - particularly the coastal Rakhine state -, leaving more than 200 injured in the two countries.\n\nExtensive damages to refugee camps in Bangladesh\xe2\x80\x99s Cox\xe2\x80\x99s Bazar district and to IDP camps in Myanmar Rakhine State have caused the already-dire humanitarian situation in these areas to deteriorate.\n\nCommunities on both sides of the border are currently without proper shelter, food, water and sanitation facilities. Protection is also a major concern.\n\nBoth Bangladesh and Myanmar are currently experiencing their annual monsoon seasons and the imminent rain will likely worsen the situation.'
