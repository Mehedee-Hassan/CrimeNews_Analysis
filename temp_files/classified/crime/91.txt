The Post Courier and The National newspapers reported that 17 prisoners were shot dead, three captured, and 57 were still at large.\n\nIt was the third mass breakout from Buimo in three years.\n\nInternational human rights groups have repeatedly called for an inquiry into PNG jails, citing concerns about overcrowding, limited access to medical treatment and delays in court proceedings.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Unfortunately these incidents, tragic as they are, happen all too frequently in Papua New Guinea as there is poor accountability with police and security officers,\xe2\x80\x99 Kate Schuetze, Amnesty International\xe2\x80\x99s Pacific Researcher, told Reuters by telephone.\n\nIn February last year, 11 prisoners were killed in an attempted breakout at Buimo after 30 prisoners attacked guards. Fifty-five men escaped from the prison in a breakout in 2015 and two years earlier one detainee was shot dead when 44 fled the same facility in another mass escape.\n\nAustralia maintains an asylum-seeker detention centre on PNG\xe2\x80\x99s Manus Island, in accordance with its policy of not allowing people who attempt to reach Australia by boat to settle in the country.\n\nThe Manus camp, one of two South Pacific island asylum seeker detention centres funded by Australia, has been criticised by human right groups and the United Nations for cramp conditions, inadequate medical facilities and violence.\n\nThe PNG Supreme Court ruled in 2016 that the camp was illegal and should close, forcing Australia to confirm it would shut down the camp by the end of 2017.\n\nAustralia struck a deal with former US president Barack Obama to take some detainees who were deemed refugees, an agreement criticised by president Donald Trump as a \xe2\x80\x98dumb deal\xe2\x80\x99 when he took office earlier this year.'
