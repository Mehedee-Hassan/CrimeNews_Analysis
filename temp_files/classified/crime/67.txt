Even, criminal case can be filed against the person involved in the irregularities.\n\nOfficials said that the organisations which did not respond to the NBR ultimatum included World Bank, UK Department for International Development, USAID, DANIDA and UNHCR.\n\nGerman International Cooperation Agency GIZ, ICDDRB, UNFPA, UNICEF, JICA, UNDP, WFP, Asia Foundation, ILO, IRRI, IFC, KOICA, WHO and CIRDAP replied to the NBR notices.\n\n\n\n'
