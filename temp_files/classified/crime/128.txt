b'How NATO is becoming a threat to Europe..How NATO is becoming a threat to Europe.\nA young boy looks down the sights of a gun on a Stryker vehicle during the \xe2\x80\x98Dragoon Ride\xe2\x80\x99 military exercise in Kupiskis some 160km north of the capital Vilnius, Lithuania, on June 12, 2016. \xe2\x80\x94 PAimages/Mindaugas Kulbis\n\nSometimes, Europe marches to catastrophe; often, it stumbles there, writes Harry Blain\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x98IS RUSSIA preparing for war?\xe2\x80\x99 read the headline of an International Business Times article on January 12. The story was about the movement of 4,000 US troops, along with 87 American tanks and 144 armoured vehicles, into Poland.\n\nBBC News ran a similar story the previous week, headlined \xe2\x80\x98US tanks arrive in Germany to help NATO defences.\xe2\x80\x99 It was about \xe2\x80\x98the largest shipment of US brigades since the fall of the Soviet Union\xe2\x80\x99 arriving in Northern Germany, ready to move east.\n\nA welcome ceremony was led by Poland\xe2\x80\x99s prime minister, while the deputy commander of US land forces in Europe labelled the troop build-up a \xe2\x80\x98concrete sign of the continued US commitment to the defence of Poland and the NATO alliance.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nThe troops will be stationed at a number of Polish military bases over the next nine months, and also carry out training exercises in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary. A Kremlin spokesman, predictably, characterised this as \xe2\x80\x98a threat to us\xe2\x80\x99 adding that \xe2\x80\x98this is a third nation that is increasing its military presence near our borders in Europe, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not even a European nation.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Enhanced security\xe2\x80\x99\n\nTHE reasons for jitters in Eastern European and Baltic countries are well-known, stemming mainly from Russia\xe2\x80\x99s annexation of Crimea in March 2014, as well as the new US president\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to question the purpose and funding of NATO. Russian military exercises and reinforcements add to the anxiety.\n\nThe Alliance, however, has not hesitated to engage in what the foreign policy think-tanks like to call \xe2\x80\x98shows of resolve\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98greater allied cooperation\xe2\x80\x99, or \xe2\x80\x98enhanced security.\xe2\x80\x99 In 2016 alone, NATO and its partners planned around 150 different military exercises, many of which were obviously aimed at Russia. Here is an incomplete list from NATO\xe2\x80\x99s own record:\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Brilliant Jump Alert\xe2\x80\x99 from April 1\xe2\x80\x9310, which \xe2\x80\x98tested the activation process of NATO\xe2\x80\x99s Spearhead force, the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force\xe2\x80\x99, and involved \xe2\x80\x98numerous military headquarters and units\xe2\x80\x99 in Poland and Albania, as well as Spain and the UK.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Ramstein Alloy\xe2\x80\x99 in Estonia from April 19\xe2\x80\x9320, an \xe2\x80\x98air exercise focused on enhancing interoperability among Allies and with partners, as well as exercising Baltic Air Policing aircraft.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Flaming Sword\xe2\x80\x99 from May 1\xe2\x80\x9320 in Lithuania and Latvia: \xe2\x80\x98a multinational exercise testing special operations forces\xe2\x80\x99, which involved \xe2\x80\x98forces from NATO nations and partners, including: Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Latvia, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Baltops 16\xe2\x80\x99: \xe2\x80\x98a US-led multinational exercise\xe2\x80\x99 in and around the Baltic Sea, \xe2\x80\x98focused on interoperability with regional partner nations in the maritime, air, and land domains.\xe2\x80\x99 2016\xe2\x80\x99s exercise \xe2\x80\x98involved around 5,800 troops from Allied and partner nations.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Flaming Thunder\xe2\x80\x99: An \xe2\x80\x98annual Lithuanian-led live-fire exercise\xe2\x80\x99 focusing on \xe2\x80\x98artillery and mortar fire training\xe2\x80\x99 from August 1\xe2\x80\x9312.\n\nAnd, in June, \xe2\x80\x98the largest Allied exercise\xe2\x80\x99 of the year \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x98Anakonda\xe2\x80\x99. A \xe2\x80\x98Polish-led exercise\xe2\x80\x99 which \xe2\x80\x98tested the readiness and interoperability of Polish Armed Forces with participating Allies and partners\xe2\x80\x99, involving around 31,000 troops from 23 different countries.\n\nAlthough many of these exercises occur regularly, they are clearly escalating. \xe2\x80\x98Anakonda\xe2\x80\x99 was the largest war game in Eastern Europe since the end of the Cold War, \xe2\x80\x98Flaming Thunder\xe2\x80\x99 involved Ukrainian troops for the first time, and the Obama Administration\xe2\x80\x99s parting gift to NATO\xe2\x80\x99s European Reassurance Initiative was a quadrupling of funding over 2016 levels to around $3.42 billion in 2017.\n\nThis will eventually ensure a \xe2\x80\x98persistent, rotational presence of air, land, and sea forces in Central and Eastern Europe\xe2\x80\x99, an expansion in \xe2\x80\x98the scope of 28 joint and multi-national exercises\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98additional combat vehicles and supplies\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98a continuous presence of three fully equipped Army Brigade Combat Teams\xe2\x80\x99 in Europe.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Deterrence\xe2\x80\x99\n\nIS THERE any problem with this? War games are not secretive \xe2\x80\x94 in fact, they are announced months in advance. Russia always knows exactly when and where a NATO exercise is taking place; its president also surely knew they would become more frequent and forceful as a result of the annexation of Crimea and the deepening turmoil in Ukraine. The point, say NATO\xe2\x80\x99s supporters, is to simply send the message that an act of aggression will not be tolerated: \xe2\x80\x98deterrence.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nThe Russian leadership sees it differently. As US troops march into Poland, they ask how the Americans would react to thousands of Russian soldiers in, say, Cuba. Cuba has had every reason to fear US aggression \xe2\x80\x94 regular assassination attempts on their former president, an invasion, the harbouring of exiled plane hijackers, an endless economic war \xe2\x80\x94 but 4,000 Russian troops would represent a dangerous escalation, as was the presence of Soviet nuclear missiles on the island in the 60s.\n\nMany Latin American countries share Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s complaints: Nicaragua faced a long and bloody war against a US-trained mercenary army in the 80s; Panama was invaded in 1989; Guatemala suffered irreparable damaged from a CIA-sponsored coup in 1954; Venezuela had to face down a US-backed coup as late as 2002; and a coup in Honduras was lied about and then rubber-stamped by Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s State Department in 2009.\n\nSo, when a Polish militiaman tells Sky News that he is taking up arms because \xe2\x80\x98history shows us what our neighbours can do\xe2\x80\x99, many people in Latin America know exactly what he means. Yet, in both cases, the involvement of foreign forces is perfectly capable of inflaming, rather than reducing fears and tensions.\n\nMilitias, autocracy, corruption\n\nA GOOD lesson of European history is that wars can arise not just from expansionist dictators, but also from foolish military posturing and alliances capable of turning the murder of an Austrian Duke into a world war. Sometimes, Europe marches to catastrophe; often, it stumbles there.\n\nWith this in mind, is it possible that the Polish government\xe2\x80\x99s encouragement of \xe2\x80\x98pro-defence\xe2\x80\x99 armed paramilitary groups \xe2\x80\x94 now with around 1,00,000 members \xe2\x80\x94 could backfire? Tens of thousands of angry, patriotic young men with guns and armoured vehicles near the border with Russia\xe2\x80\x99s Kaliningrad territory? Wages paid by a government described by the former president of the Constitutional Court as taking the country down \xe2\x80\x98the road to autocracy\xe2\x80\x99 and which has promised to lead a \xe2\x80\x98cultural counter-revolution\xe2\x80\x99 in Europe? Apparently, NATO is unconcerned. It was even kind enough to include some of Poland\xe2\x80\x99s paramilitary units in the Anakonda exercise in June.\n\nWhile Poland is a full NATO member that must be defended in the event of conflict with Russia, Ukraine, a NATO \xe2\x80\x98partner\xe2\x80\x99, is already mired in one. Ukraine is such a good \xe2\x80\x98partner\xe2\x80\x99 that it hosted around 2,000 troops from the US and \xe2\x80\x9811 other Allied and partner nations\xe2\x80\x99 for Exercise Rapid Trident last year, during which Ukrainian soldiers practiced \xe2\x80\x98setting up roadblocks\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98urban combat\xe2\x80\x99, and \xe2\x80\x98air assaults\xe2\x80\x99, with \xe2\x80\x98equipment from individual rifles to helicopters and tanks.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nIn the almost total absence of western media coverage, we could be forgiven for not knowing that there were NATO troops in Ukraine. We could also be forgiven for not knowing that the Speaker of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s Parliament co-founded the neo-Nazi Social-National Party, or that its Interior Minister has promoted neo-Nazis to senior positions in the National Police, or that the government renamed a major boulevard \xe2\x80\x98in honour of Stepan Bandera, the leader of partisan groups responsible for the slaughter of thousands of Jews and over 100,000 Poles during WWII.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nUkraine is also a \xe2\x80\x98corrupt swamp.\xe2\x80\x99 In 2015, Joe Biden told Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s parliament that corruption was \xe2\x80\x98eating\xe2\x80\x99 the country \xe2\x80\x98like a cancer\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 days after pledging $190 million in extra aid. The Panama Papers revealed how the president, Petro Poroshenko, set up a secret offshore firm in August 2014 \xe2\x80\x98when his troops were being wiped out in eastern Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99, while the economy minister resigned in February 2016, citing the presence of \xe2\x80\x98covert corruption\xe2\x80\x99 in the government. Since the \xe2\x80\x98Euromaidan Revolution\xe2\x80\x99, president Poroshenko\xe2\x80\x99s approval ratings have even fallen below Viktor Yanukovych\xe2\x80\x99s on the eve of his ouster.\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that Russia has stoked political unrest in Ukraine and breached the 1994 Budapest Memorandum ensuring Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity in exchange for the dismantling of its nuclear weapons. But to reduce the country\xe2\x80\x99s predicament to Russian adventurism is to ignore the dangers of militarily and politically supporting a regime that we know to be corrupt, at times brutal and too close to the far-right.\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nRECENT history gives us some guide of what can go wrong. Georgia \xe2\x80\x94 also a NATO partner, rather than member \xe2\x80\x94 had its membership bid endorsed in principle by the Alliance in April 2008. By August, it was at war with Russia.\n\nThe war, fought over the breakaway Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, was widely presented as a case of Russian aggression; however, the EU\xe2\x80\x99s investigation led by the Swiss diplomat Heidi Tagliavini blamed Georgia for starting it. Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s president, Mikheil Saakashvili, was left disappointed at the lack of support from western allies.\n\nBizarrely, Mr Saakashvili \xe2\x80\x94 whose party lost office in 2012 \xe2\x80\x94 was appointed governor of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s Odessa region by Poroshenko in May 2015. He resigned just over a year later, accusing the Ukrainian president of supporting \xe2\x80\x98a criminal bandit clan\xe2\x80\x99 of politicians in the region. \xe2\x80\x98Nobody in my life has lied so much or so cynically to me\xe2\x80\x99, he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Knowing him, he tends to exaggerate\xe2\x80\x99, Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s former health minister retorted. These are the men who NATO has trusted and invested in.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Obsolete\xe2\x80\x99?\n\nTHE founding goal of NATO, in the words of its first secretary general, was to \xe2\x80\x98keep the Russians out, the Americans in and the Germans down.\xe2\x80\x99 This has been complicated by the fall of the Soviet Union and the expansion of the Alliance to the east, which has led it into alignment with volatile governments expecting support in the event of conflict with Russia. If that time comes, Crimea will look like a historical footnote.\n\nNATO may not yet be \xe2\x80\x98obsolete\xe2\x80\x99, as president Trump has suggested. But, having helped maintain Europe\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98brutal peace\xe2\x80\x99 since 1945, the Alliance could now be a threat to it.\n\nOpenDemocracy.net, January 27.
