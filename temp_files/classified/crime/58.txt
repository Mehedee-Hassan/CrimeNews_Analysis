They weren\xe2\x80\x99t armed. Most of them were executed,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\nThe GNA said in a statement late Friday a commission of inquiry had been set up to investigate the attack.\n\nIt said it had decided to suspend its defence minister, al-Mahdi al-Barghati, and the head of the Third Force from their duties until those responsible were identified.\n\nBoth the GNA and defence ministry earlier condemned the assault and said they had not ordered any such action.\n\nThe unity government, the rival administration in eastern Libya and their respective backers are battling for influence in the North African country which has been wracked by chaos since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.\n\nThe LNA does not recognise the authority of the GNA, and instead supports the rival authorities based in the east.\n\nThe UN envoy to Libya earlier on Friday voiced alarm at reports of the attack on the base, 650 kilometres south of Tripoli.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I am outraged by reports of significant numbers of fatalities, including civilians and by reports that summary executions may have taken place,\xe2\x80\x99 UN envoy Martin Kobler said in a statement.\n\nBritain\xe2\x80\x99s ambassador to Libya, Peter Millett, also denounced the assault.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Disgusted by attack on Brak al-Shati & reports of mass executions. Perpetrators must be brought to justice,\xe2\x80\x99 he wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe incident at the base in Wadi al-Shati district comes a month after an attack by the LNA on the Tamenhant airbase controlled by the Third Force near the south\xe2\x80\x99s main city of Sebha.\n\nThat attack was called off after a reconciliation meeting between Haftar and unity government head Fayez al-Sarraj in Abu Dhabi on May 2.\n\nThe speaker of the eastern-based parliament, which is supported by the LNA, accused the Misrata-based Third Force of a \xe2\x80\x98serious breach of the truce agreement reached in Abu Dhabi\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nAguila Saleh said there were a \xe2\x80\x98number of martyrs\xe2\x80\x99 in LNA ranks, without giving a figure.\n\nThe speaker said he had given orders for the armed forces \xe2\x80\x98to take the measures necessary to respond to the assault and defend the south and cleanse it of all outlaw militias\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nIn Tripoli, the GNA called for an immediate ceasefire in the south, where tribes and militias vie for control of lucrative smuggling routes with neighbouring Chad, Niger and Sudan.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We hope reason will prevail and that the escalation and provocation will stop,\xe2\x80\x99 it said.\n\nThe unity government\xe2\x80\x99s defence ministry laid the blame on \xe2\x80\x98those who started bombing Tamenhant base with warplanes and tanks\xe2\x80\x99, referring to Haftar\xe2\x80\x99s forces.\n\nIn new violence on Friday, a pro-Haftar tribal chief, Sheikh Ibrayek Alwati, and five other people including a child were killed in a car bombing outside a mosque in the eastern city of Slouq, medical and security sources said.\n\nMore about: Libya'
