The UN peacekeeping mission said the remaining attackers fled into the bush.\n\nThe UN mission sent a helicopter and additional troops to secure the site near Bangassou, about 474 kilometers (295 miles) east of the capital, Bangui, and were continuing to search for the missing peacekeeper, Dujarric said.\n\nIn the initial ambush and firefight, one Cambodian peacekeeper was killed and seven Moroccans and one Cambodian were injured, he said.\n\nThree Cambodian soldiers and one Moroccan peacekeeper were also reported missing, according to UN and Cambodian officials. Dujarric said three of the missing peacekeepers were later found dead. He said he did not know their nationalities.\n\nThe injured peacekeepers were evacuated by helicopter to the capital and are now receiving medical aid, he said, and the United Nations is coordinating with government officials \xe2\x80\x98to ensure the perpetrators are arrested and brought to justice.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nUN secretary-general Antonio Guterres issued a statement late Tuesday strongly condemning the attack and stressing \xe2\x80\x98that attacks against United Nations peacekeepers may constitute a war crime.\xe2\x80\x99 He urged Central African Republic authorities \xe2\x80\x98to swiftly bring those responsible to justice.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nThe country descended into sectarian conflict in 2013 when Muslim rebels overthrew the nation\xe2\x80\x99s Christian president.\n\nThe United Nations launched a peacekeeping mission there in 2014 and now has more than 12,000 troops deployed to protect civilians from violence between Christian and Muslim factions. Some 890,000 people have been displaced inside the country and into neighbouring Cameroon, the UN says.\n\nThe latest fighting began in February and Human Rights Watch said last week that at least 45 people have been killed and 11,000 displaced in attacks by armed groups that have also targeted civilians.\n\nOne predominantly Peul faction of the mostly Muslim Seleka group has been fighting since late 2016 with another faction that has aligned itself with the Christian anti-Balaka group as they vie for control of the central part of the country, the rights group said.\n\nCambodian prime minister Hun Sen announced news of the attack in video remarks published on his official Facebook page.\n\nHe said the Cambodians were part of an engineering unit that was helping to build roads, bridges and other infrastructure. The ambush took place as the Cambodians were on the way back to their base with an escort of Moroccan soldiers.\n\nChhum Socheath, a spokesman for the Cambodian national defence ministry, said the slain peacekeeper was a captain and his body was being sent home. Cambodia has deployed 12 soldiers to the central African nation in recent months, he said.\n\nOver the weekend, four international aid groups said they would temporarily withdraw their workers from parts of northern Central African Republic because of increasing attacks targeting them.
