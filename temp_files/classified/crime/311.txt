b'Farhad\xe2\x80\x99s abductors must be brought to task..Farhad\xe2\x80\x99s abductors must be brought to task.\nWE ARE relieved, temporarily though, that Farhad Mazhar, a renowned poet and newspaper columnist of the country, has returned home and was admitted to hospital after being \xe2\x80\x98abducted\xe2\x80\x99 without any major injury in this time of enforced disappearances of political opponents of the incumbents. Farhad, after all, often appears intellectually critical of the government\xe2\x80\x99s undemocratic actions and inactions while opposing Delhi\xe2\x80\x99s hegemonic aspirations around Bangladesh when Delhi remains a source of power for the incumbents. However, our relief is temporary, for it is not yet clear as to who were behind Farhad\xe2\x80\x99s abduction, why he was abducted and what forced the abductors to free him without any \xe2\x80\x98ransom\xe2\x80\x99 that they had initially demanded. Farhad, \xe2\x80\x98extremely traumatised\xe2\x80\x99 by the horrible incident, and, therefore, receiving medical treatment, is still not in a position to brief the public about what had exactly happened. Once he recovers, we hope, he would open his mouth about the unfortunate incident. The police, particularly the home affairs minister, have publicly pledged that the law enforcement agencies would find out the answers, inform the public and take the perpetrators of the crime to task. If that so happens, credibly, we would feel relieved about it \xe2\x80\x94 at least for the time being, while government would be able to prove its innocence in the abduction case.\n\nWe, at New Age, do not at all subscribe to Farhad\xe2\x80\x99s recent political preaching as any solution to Bangladesh\xe2\x80\x99s problem of democratic transformation \xe2\x80\x94 social, political, economic and cultural. Instead, we find his Islamist views quite right-wing, which, if materialised, would rather further shrink democratic spaces for freethinking citizens while the religious minority communities would be exposed to more difficulties. Still, we believe that he has the right to express his views freely and it is up to the people in general whether or not they would accept his sermons. We do not endorse the idea of punishing anyone for his/her personal political views. It is to be noted here that the major political parties of inherently undemocratic ruling classes of the country, such as the Bangladesh Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, are there in alliances, directly or indirectly, with various Islamist political groups, Hefazat-e-Islam and Jamaat-e-Islami for instance, who preach similar right-wing political views.\n\nBe that as it may, Farhad\xe2\x80\x99s case of alleged abduction by yet-to-be identified criminals has brought forth again the terrible issue of enforced disappearances allegedly by the state actors, which became evident in public reactions to the issue on the social media. The incumbents should realise by now that that the general public is intelligent enough not to buy into the cock and bull stories that different agencies come up with after every incident of disappearance or \xe2\x80\x98encounter\xe2\x80\x99 death. The authorities concerned should, therefore, take effective steps to stop the recurrence of disappearances and custodial deaths in society and credibly resolve the previous cases of enforced disappearances by both the state and non-state actors. In case of a failure, the menace would perpetuate in the next regime and take its toll on the incumbents of the day. Not a good idea for any quarters.\n\nMore about:'
