We'll go through that and work it out.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nHe said it was possible that Khayre may have been attempting to lure police by taking the escort -- reportedly a sex worker -- hostage.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We still don't know exactly whether that was the case,\xe2\x80\x99 Ashton said, but police believed he was acting alone and there was no ongoing threat.\n\nThe Amaq news agency -- which is affiliated with IS -- carried a statement claiming responsibility.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The executor of the Melbourne attack in Australia is a soldier of the Islamic State and he carried out the attack in response to appeals to target citizens of coalition states,\xe2\x80\x99 it said.\n\nAshton said IS \xe2\x80\x98always tend to jump up and claim responsibility every time something happens\xe2\x80\x99 and it was too early to determine whether they were involved.\n\nAuthorities had responded to reports of an explosion at the building -- which turned out to be a gunshot -- in the affluent beach suburb of Brighton and arrived to find a dead body in the foyer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Subsequently he (Khayre) came out of the apartment with a shotgun and commenced to fire at police at the entryway to the apartments,\xe2\x80\x99 Ashton said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98He's exchanged gunfire with police and has been fatally shot by police at the scene.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nThe escort escaped unharmed but three police were wounded in the firefight, although their injuries were not life-threatening.\n\nPrime minister Malcolm Turnbull said the attack underlined the need to be constantly vigilant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98This terrorist attack by a known criminal, a man who was only recently released on parole, is a shocking, cowardly crime,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a terrorist attack and it underlines the need for us to be constantly vigilant, never to be deterred, always defiant, in the face of Islamist terrorism.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nAustralian officials have grown increasingly concerned over the threat of extremist attacks.\n\nThey say they have prevented 12 attacks on home soil since the threat level was raised in September 2014, including a foiled Christmas Day plot in Melbourne last year, with more than 60 people charged.\n\nBut four have gone ahead, including the murder of a Sydney police employee in 2015 by a 15-year-old boy.\n\nKhayre, whose parents were refugees from Somalia, was known to police and had a long criminal history.\n\nHe was charged and acquitted over a foiled plot to attack the Holsworthy Army barracks in Sydney in 2009.\n\nThree of his co-accused were found guilty of planning the terrorist assault as payback for Australia's military action in the Middle East.\n\nKhayre was released on parole late last year after serving time for intent to cause injury and arson, which Turnbull said was a concern given his background and something that would be reviewed."
