I will never be complicit in any act of violence,\xe2\x80\x99 Maduro said in a speech at a military parade in Caracas. He did not acknowledge that those who stormed congress were supporters of his side.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I have ordered an investigation, and may justice be done.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nMilitary police guarding the site stood by as about 100 intruders brandishing sticks and pipes, and one of them a gun, broke through the front gate of the National Assembly and into the interior gardens, AFP reporters observed.\n\nThe mob reached as far as the corridors of the congressional building, striking and injuring lawmakers and ordering journalists to leave the premises.\n\nThe speaker of the assembly, Julio Borges, in a Twitter message named five lawmakers he said were hurt in the violence. Some were taken away for medical treatment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98This does not hurt as much as seeing every day how we are losing our country,\xe2\x80\x99 one of them, Armando Armas, told reporters as he got into an ambulance with his head wrapped in bloodied bandages.\n\nDeputies also said that two employees of the assembly were hurt.\n\nDuring the hours-long siege, government backers gathered at the gates screamed \xe2\x80\x98killers\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98terrorists\xe2\x80\x99 at the opposition lawmakers inside. At one point, lawmaker Williams Davila of the foreign affairs commission told reporters, \xe2\x80\x98we have been kidnapped.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nPolice with shields protected them as they finally filed out of the legislature building.\n\nThree months of anti-government protests have seen 91 people killed in clashes with police.\n\nProtesters blame Maduro for a desperate economic crisis that has caused shortages of food, medicine and such basics as soap. He says the chaos is the result of a US-backed capitalist conspiracy by the opposition.\n\nThe opposition-controlled legislature was holding a special session to mark independence day when the government supporters burst in.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We will not be intimidated by these acts of violence. No one here will surrender to this dictatorship,\xe2\x80\x99 said senior opposition lawmaker Freddy Guevara.\n\nEarlier Maduro's vice-president Tareck El Aissami had made an impromptu appearance in the congress along with the head of the armed forces, Vladimir Padrino Lopez, and ministers.\n\nEl Aissami made an address in which he called on supporters of Maduro to come to the legislature to show support for the president.\n\nA crowd of Maduro supporters held a rally outside the building for several hours before breaking into the grounds during a recess.\n\nThe government and opposition have accused each other of using armed groups to sow violence.\n\nMaduro retains the public backing of the military high command \xe2\x80\x94 a key factor in keeping him in power, according to analysts \xe2\x80\x94 but the president last month said he was replacing four senior commanders of the armed forces.\n\nMaduro has infuriated his opponents by launching a plan to form an assembly tasked with rewriting the constitution.\n\nOpponents say he will pack this constituent assembly with allies in a bid to cling to power.\n\nVoting for members of the assembly is scheduled for July 30.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98However, the political crisis is so fluid that the country could reach a tipping point before then,\xe2\x80\x99 wrote analysts from the Eurasia Group consultancy last week in a note.\n\nThe opposition on Monday said it would hold a popular vote on July 16 against the constitutional reform plan."
