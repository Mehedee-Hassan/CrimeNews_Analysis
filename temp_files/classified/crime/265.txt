The United Nations has said the military committed rapes, killings and burned down homes in what amounted to crimes against humanity.\n\nIn the first detailed on-the-ground assessment of the community affected by the violence since October, the WFP interviewed 450 families in 45 villages in Maungdaw district in March and April.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The survey confirmed a worsening of the food security situation in already highly vulnerable areas (since October),\xe2\x80\x99 the UN agency said. About a third of those surveyed reported \xe2\x80\x98extreme ...food insecurity\xe2\x80\x99 such as going a day and night without eating.\n\nNot one of the children covered in the survey was getting a \xe2\x80\x98minimum adequate diet,\xe2\x80\x99 the report said, adding that an estimated 80,500 children under the age of five would need treatment for acute malnutrition in the next year.\n\nSuu Kyi\xe2\x80\x99s administration is refusing to grant access to a United Nations-mandated mission tasked with investigating allegations of abuses by security forces in Rakhine and elsewhere.\n\nThe WFP does not distinguish between different communities, but more than 90 percent of residents in Maungdaw are Rohingya. Many in Myanmar see the group as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.\n\nFollowing the attacks, the military declared an operation zone in Maungdaw, restricting aid access and preventing locals from fishing and farming.\n\nA WFP map shows that villages where the military was most active were highly vulnerable to hunger.\n\nThe report also notes that households where the men left due to security operations were more likely to go hungry. Many Rohingya men fled their homes because they believed the military would target them as suspected militants.\n\nSuu Kyi\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman, Zaw Htay, said he was not familiar with the specific WFP findings, but that after initial security restrictions the government had been allowing aid agencies to operate in northern Rakhine.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The WFP is conducting many, many projects for the people in that region. The Myanmar government is allowing them to deliver food and other assistance,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\nThe government continued to restrict some access for foreign aid workers in northern Rakhine, but national staff could move freely, he said, adding the government has delivered aid to people in the area.\n\n\n\n'
