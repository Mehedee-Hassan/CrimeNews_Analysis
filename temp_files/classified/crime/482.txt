b"Philippine mayor among 10 killed in shootout..Philippine mayor among 10 killed in shootout.\nPolice inspect the contents of the vehicles following an operation Friday, October 28, 2016 at Makilala township, North Cotabato province in southern Philippines. \xe2\x80\x93 AP photo\n\nA mayor on Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte's wanted list for alleged drugs links was killed along with nine of his guards in a shootout on Friday, police said, as a new phase of a bloody narcotics crackdown zeroed-in on high profile targets.\n\nThe 10 men succumbed to their wounds en route to hospital, police said, having opened fire on officers who tried to stop their two vehicles at a checkpoint in Duterte's troubled home province of Mindanao before dawn.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98It was a legitimate police operation,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bernard Tayong of the North Cotabato police office, adding that no officers were hurt but a police vehicle was riddled with bullets.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We have information the mayor and his men were transporting drugs so we tried to intercept them but they chose to shoot it out,\xe2\x80\x99 he told reporters.\n\nThe killing of Samsudin Dimaukom, a powerful mayor, took place far from his predominantly Muslim town of Datu Saudi Ampatuan.\n\nIt came as police shift tactics in the controversial war on drugs by focusing on politicians, government officials, celebrities and high-ranking army and police suspected of involvement in the trade.\n\nThe new plan, called \xe2\x80\x98project double barrel alpha\xe2\x80\x99, was reported exclusively by Reuters on Monday and aims to increase arrests and reduce the bloodshed in a campaign that has claimed more than 2,300 lives since Duterte took office on June 30.\n\nDuterte won a May election on the promises of killing criminals and campaigned under the logo of a clenched fist.\n\nDuterte returned from a visit to Japan late on Thursday and during a news conference waved a thick book he said contained names of officials suspected of drug links. The book contains about 3,000 names.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not want to make this public because it will just make the Filipino cry,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\nOf those killed in the anti-drugs campaign, more than 1,600 died during police operations, a toll that has drawn international concern about extrajudicial killings.\n\nDuterte has fiercely defended the campaign and has repeatedly lashed out at his critics.\n\nA recent poll showed public unease over the crackdown, with 94 per cent of respondents saying it was important that police take suspects alive.\n\nPolice investigators said seven guns, including an Armalite rifle and 13 small packs of suspected methamphetamines were recovered from the mayor's vehicle after Friday's firefight.\n\nThe mayor's wife, who is also the town's vice mayor, is also on Duterte's wanted list.\n\nNational police spokesman Dionardo Carlos told Reuters on Thursday the drugs war had been expanded to go beyond poorer areas where low-level peddlers operate.\n\nNew targets were transport networks, show business circles, nightclubs and wealthier neighbourhoods to root out drugs like cocaine and ecstasy.\n\nCarlos denied there was a deliberate sanctioning of extrajudicial killings. He said fatalities occurred when suspects refused to surrender and police were keen to avoid violence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98That's why we are shifting to Alpha,\xe2\x80\x99 he added.\n\nSince late June, 750,000 drug users had surrendered, some 30,000 suspects were arrested. Of the \xe2\x80\x98high value\xe2\x80\x99 targets, 201 had surrendered, 66 were arrested and 14 were killed.\n\nHe said 150,000 police had been drug tested and 164 gave positive results and would be dismissed.\n\nPolice would soon receive a large consignment of body armour, Carlos said, adding instructions were being given \xe2\x80\x98to make sure you are not giving (drug suspects) the chance to put your lives in danger\xe2\x80\x99."
