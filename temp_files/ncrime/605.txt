Browning uses his arms to control the direction and speed of the flight.\n\nBrowning said it is easily capable of flying at 200mph (321km/h) and an altitude of a few thousand feet. But, for safety reasons, he keeps the altitude and speed low.\n\nHe insisted it is \xe2\x80\x98safer than a motorbike\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nThe suit can currently fly uninterrupted for around 10 minutes.\n\nThe start-up he founded, Gravity, is working on new technology for the device which Browning said will make the current prototype look \xe2\x80\x98like child's play\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nSince video of his maiden flight went on YouTube, he has had thousands of views and interest from investors and the UK military.\n\nBut he does not think that the system is about to go mainstream anytime soon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I think of it as a bit like a jet ski, a bit of fun or a indulgent toy, but I do have a hunch that stuff will come along to make it more practical.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nIt remains a fascinating project for those who see it in action.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98There is something strange in seeing the human form rise up and drift around and that leaves a deep impression on people,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\nThe Civil Aviation Authority has yet to take any decisions on the level of regulation required for jetpacks.\n\nAnd in Europe, the European Aviation Safety Agency, which has responsibility for approving all new aircraft designs, including experimental concepts, has not yet formed an opinion on human propulsion technology.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Going forward it may be necessary to create a new category of regulation for this technology as it clearly does not fit in neatly with aircraft regulation,\xe2\x80\x99 a CAA spokesman told the BBC.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Ultimately, I think it unlikely that such technology would be completely deregulated.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x98This is potentially powered flight after all, unlike activities such as hang-gliding and paragliding which are deregulated. High speed human propulsion could easily conflict with low flying aircraft and so the 'pilot' would almost certainly need some kind of training and a licence.\xe2\x80\x99"
