b'Investment in savings tools crosses Tk 50,000cr in FY17..Investment in savings tools crosses Tk 50,000cr in FY17.\nThe net investment in the national savings certificates and bonds is set to cross Tk 50,000 crore for the first time in the country\xe2\x80\x99s history in the just concluded financial year 2016-17 as the net sales of the savings tools stood at Tk 46,669 crore in the first 11 months of the year.\n\nAccording to the latest data of the Directorate of National Savings, net investment in the tools increased by 55.08 per cent to Tk 46,669 crore in the July-May period of FY17 compared with that of Tk 30,092 crore in the corresponding period of FY16.\n\nA DNS official said that although they were yet to get the investment data of June, the net investment in the savings tools might have crossed Tk 50,000 crore in the FY 17 as there was huge rush to buy the NSCs in the last month of the year.\n\nThe net investment in the savings tools stood at Tk 4,571 crore in May, Tk 4,450 crore in April, Tk 4,366 crore in March, Tk 4,388 crore in February and Tk 5,420 crore in January this year.\n\nDNS and Bangladesh Bank officials said people had been maintaining a huge investment in the last few months as the government earlier hinted at lowering the rate on the tools with a view to reducing the interest rate gap between the NSCs and other rates of deposit products offered by the banks.\n\nThe government, however, is yet to take any final decision whether it will cut the rate on the tools, they said.\n\nPeople are now being forced to invest their money in the NSC savings tools as the banks are offering hardly 7 per cent interest rate on their deposit products.\n\nThe rates offered by the NSCs are between 11.04 per cent and 11.76 per cent, a BB official said.\n\nBesides, a section of people including politicians and bureaucrats are also making huge investment to enjoy higher returns from the tools, he said.\n\nThe high returns on the savings tools are pushing up the government\xe2\x80\x99s interest liability as the government usually borrows from treasury bills and bonds, that carry interest rates between 2.84 per cent and 7.60 per cent, to manage its deficit financing of the fiscal budget, he said.\n\nIn the budget for FY17, the government aimed to borrow Tk 19,610 crore from the NSCs, but it later revised the figure and set a borrowing target of Tk 45,000 crore.\n\nThe BB official said that the high net investment in the savings tools would continue this fiscal year if the government did not cut the rate on the savings tools.\n\nFormer caretaker government adviser Mirza Azizul Islam told New Age on Wednesday that people\n\nhad opted to invest in the savings tools as the interest rate on the deposit products offered by the banks was now equivalent to the inflation rate.\n\nIn many cases, the rate on the banks\xe2\x80\x99 products is below inflation rate resulting that people are making investment in the tools heavily in recent time, he said.\n\nThe situation will not improve despite the government cut two-three per cent interest rate on the savings tools due to the much lower rate on the banks\xe2\x80\x99 deposit products, he said.\n\nAgainst the backdrop, the government should stop selling the national savings certificates when its budgetary borrowing target will be fulfilled, he pointed out.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about:'
