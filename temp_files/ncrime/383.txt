But our ministry maintains a firm position to foster competition between private bus companies and BRTC,\xe2\x80\x99 said Siddique.\n\nOn March 13, BRTC opened its air-conditioned bus service on Dhaka-Munshiganj route and only two days later the police shut down BRTC\xe2\x80\x99s ticket counter at Gulistan.\n\nPassengers saw private bus company men accompanying the police when the BRTC\xe2\x80\x99s ticket counter was shut down.\n\nDhaka Metropolitan Police deputy commissioner Md Mainul Islam told New Age that the ticketing counter was shut down as BRTC opened it without taking permission from the police.\n\nHe also said that before opening the Dhaka-Munshiganj bus service \xe2\x80\x98BRTC had sought our opinion and before we could give our opinion they inaugurated the route.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nThe Road Transport Corporation Ordinance 1961 authorizes BRTC to operate motor transport on any route it thinks fit.\n\nSince 2010, out of 958 buses imported spending about Tk 620 crore, BRTC pressed 473 buses on its city routes in Dhaka and Chittagong while 318 buses were pressed on inter-district routes.\n\nNow, 717 of the buses imported since 2010 are operational, 141 are under heavy repairing, four have been declared as Beyond Economic Repair and 14 more are waiting to be declared as BER.\n\nBRTC operates direct bus service between Dhaka and 20 outlying districts.\n\nBRTC also runs bus service on other inter-district routes providing travel facilities between almost all the 64 districts, mostly skirting the capital, said officials.\n\nMajor routes BRTC was forced to give up include, Dhaka-Sunamganj, Sylhet-Chittagong, Sylhet-Khulna, Barisal-Benapole, Dhaka-Bogra, Dhaka-Kabirhat, Chittagong-Bhola, Comilla-Rangpur and Panchagar-Pirojpur.\n\nFollowing obstructions from private bus companies BRTC also had to wind up its Dhaka- Patharghata bus service and Narayanganj-Jamalpur service immediately after opening them, said officials.\n\nOfficials said BRTC faced obstructions from private bus operators while opening all the bus service on almost 214 routes.\n\nThey said that BRTC was compelled to wind up its bus service on so many routes due to the ties wealthy and influential private bus service owners maintain with the high ups in the administration.\n\nOn August 16, 2013, BRTC had pressed two AC buses on its Dhaka-Ghorasal-Sylhet route and 15 days later was forced to shut it down on orders from the higher authorities, said a BRTC official.\n\nLater, BRTC launched Dhaka-Jatrabari-Sylhet bus service leaving the Dhaka-Ghorashal-Sylhet route to Ena Transport, he said.\n\nIt takes about six hours to reach Sylhet from Dhaka via Ghorashal but it takes about 10 to 12 hours to reach Sylhet from Dhaka via Jatrabari-Gausia-Kanchpur Bridge, he said.\n\nEna Transport charges Tk 750 for each seat on AC coach for the travel between Dhaka and Sylhet via Ghorasal while BRTC used to charge Tk 550 for each seat on its AC coach, said the official.\n\nFinally, BRTC had to abandon its Dhaka-Jatrabari-Sylhet service as no passenger was willing to pay more, he said.\n\nLater, he said, BRTC rerouted the service between Dhaka and Sunamganj and was again forced to abandon it, he added.\n\nBRTC stops its buses on Dhaka-Mymensingh route at the turn of the Brahmaputra River as it is not allowed to stop the buses at the Mymensingh bus terminal, he said.\n\nBangladesh Road Transport Owners\xe2\x80\x99 Association secretary general and owner of Ena Transport on routes including Dhaka-Sylhet and Dhaka-Mymensingh, K Enayet Ullah, denied that they created such obstructions for BRTC.'
