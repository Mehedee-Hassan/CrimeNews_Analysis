So, there is no possibility of achieving such robust growth in the production of crops and vegetables,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\nThe government should take initiative to diversify agriculture products as the farm sector is still contributing hugely to generating employment and ensuring the country\xe2\x80\x99s food security, he added.'
