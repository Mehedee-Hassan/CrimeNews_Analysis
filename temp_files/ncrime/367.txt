The two had traded barbs during the heated battle for the White House.\n\nTrump \xe2\x80\x93 who previously called Obama the \xe2\x80\x98most ignorant president in our history\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 said it was a \xe2\x80\x98great honour\xe2\x80\x99 meeting with the US leader, adding that he looked forward to receiving the president\xe2\x80\x99s counsel.\n\nObama \xe2\x80\x93 who previously said Trump was a whiner and \xe2\x80\x98uniquely unqualified\xe2\x80\x99 to be commander-in-chief \xe2\x80\x93 vowed his support.\n\nHe told Trump that his administration would \xe2\x80\x98do everything we can to help you succeed, because if you succeed, then the country succeeds.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nThe two men ended the improbable and historic White House encounter with a handshake and refused to take questions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s a good rule. Don\xe2\x80\x99t answer questions when they just start yelling,\xe2\x80\x99 Obama told Trump, referring to the press.\n\nWhite House officials said that the two leaders discussed a range of issues including Obama's meetings with leaders from Germany, Greece and across the Asia-Pacific during foreign travel next week.\n\nOn that trip, Obama is likely to be inundated with panicked questions about America\xe2\x80\x99s role in world affairs.\n\nAnger over the Republican property mogul\xe2\x80\x99s upset election win over Clinton spilled out onto the streets of US cities late Wednesday as chanting protesters lit bonfires and snarled traffic.\n\nBut in the days after Trump\xe2\x80\x99s election win, which virtually no poll had predicted, both sides spoke of healing the deep divisions sown in a bruising two-year campaign.\n\nTrump\xe2\x80\x99s vanquished Democratic rival Clinton, holding back the bitter disappointment of not becoming America\xe2\x80\x99s first female president, urged the country to give Trump a chance.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead,\xe2\x80\x99 she said Wednesday in a concession speech.\n\nObama, addressing disconsolate staff in the White House Rose Garden, played down Trump\xe2\x80\x99s win as part of the messy \xe2\x80\x98zig-zag\xe2\x80\x99 movement of a democracy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Sometimes you lose an argument,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, adding that all Americans should now be \xe2\x80\x98rooting\xe2\x80\x99 for Trump\xe2\x80\x99s success.\n\nIn the battle for the soul of the United States, those who helped elect its first black president now appear to be in retreat and pondering whether his eight years in power have come to naught.\n\nBoth Obama and Clinton issued a faint \xe2\x80\x93 but clear \xe2\x80\x93 warning that Trump must respect institutions and the rule of law if a modicum of goodwill is to hold.\n\nThat \xe2\x80\x98likely\xe2\x80\x99 observance of rule of law may not suffice for Washington\xe2\x80\x99s partners and allies, who see an entire global political order built around US leadership cast into doubt.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel was quick to underscore the importance of shared democratic values.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98On the basis of these values, I offer close cooperation to the future president of the United States of America,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\n\nEurope, already beset by financial and social crises and internal divisions, now faces existential questions about its own security. Trump has questioned the US-led NATO's key collective defence guarantee.\n\nThe leaders of America's neighbours, Canada and Mexico, quickly made clear their willingness to work with the new president.\n\nPresident Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico, a prime target of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s anti-immigration campaign rhetoric, reached out to congratulate the incoming leader and announced they would soon meet.\n\nThe Republican Party leadership, too, embraced their newfound champion.\n\nHouse speaker Paul Ryan, who had distanced himself from Trump in the final month of the campaign, pledged to \xe2\x80\x98hit the ground running\xe2\x80\x99 and work with him on conservative legislation.\n\nThe two, along with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, met on Capitol Hill for lunch after Trump's talks with Obama.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump huddled at Trump Tower in New York with a group of advisers, planning a transition strategy to take over stewardship of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest economy.\n\nTeam Trump unveiled a transition website \xe2\x80\x93 www.greatagain.gov \xe2\x80\x93 that highlights the colossal human resources challenge facing the incoming administration under the headline \xe2\x80\x98Help wanted: 4,000 presidential appointees.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nDuring a bitter campaign that tugged at America's democratic fabric, the tycoon pledged to deport illegal immigrants, ban Muslims from the country and tear up free-trade deals.\n\nThose campaign messages were embraced by a large section of Americans, grown increasingly disgruntled by the scope of social and economic change under Obama.\n\nBut they were passionately rejected by Clinton supporters.\n\nThousands of protesters -- in New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, Portland and other cities and school campuses -- rallied Wednesday to express continued opposition to the incoming leader they accuse of racism, sexism and xenophobia.\n\nIn Los Angeles, a giant Trump head was burned in effigy."
