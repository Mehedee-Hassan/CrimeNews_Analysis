b'VAT automation to continue despite suspension of new law..VAT automation to continue despite suspension of new law.\nThe National Board of Revenue will continue its move to automate the value-added tax system under the existing law despite suspension of the new VAT law, officials said.\n\nThey said that online registration of business identification number (BIN) for all businesses and online submission of VAT returns for some selected business sectors would continue under the existing VAT law framed in 1991.\n\nInitially, importers, manufacturers and large businesses which have been paying VAT at the rate of 15 per cent will come under automation as the existing system supports it and they will be able to submit VAT returns online from next month.\n\nLarge VAT-paying units have already modified their software to avail the online service.\n\nThe NBR will decide soon whether online returns submission for the selected businesses would be made mandatory or kept as optional, they added.\n\nField level VAT offices of the revenue board are now issuing only nine-digit online BINs, commonly known as VAT registration numbers, under the VAT Online Project taken to automate the VAT system though both 11-digit old BINs and new BINs remained effective after suspension of the implementation of the new law.\n\nThe NBR, in principle, decided to annul the old BINs and a notification in thid regard will be announced soon.\n\nThe parliament on June 28 passed the Finance Bill-2017 deferring the implementation of the new VAT and Supplementary Duty Act-2012 for two more years.\n\nThe 2012 act sought to impose uniform 15 per cent VAT for all goods and services, except exempted ones, and automate the VAT system.\n\nVAT Online Project director, also a member of the NBR, Rezaul Hasan on Tuesday told New Age that they would continue automation activities under the existing law as there is a provision in the law which supports digitisation of BIN registration, returns submission, online VAT payment, audit and other automation programmes.\n\nDecisions related to the issues will be finalised soon, he said.\n\nOfficials involved with the VOP said that the NBR now got two more years to complete the automation of VAT.\n\nEven if the new law is not implemented in 2019, the revenue board will bring businesses under automated VAT system under the existing VAT law, they said.\n\nIn that case, the NBR will have to bring some changes in the existing automation process which has been prepared for single 15 per cent VAT rate under the new law to accommodate multiple rates.\n\nVOP has already communicated with the Vietnam-based vendor FPT Information System about bringing changes in the system.\n\nThey said that it would take some months to modify the online system for accommodating multiple rates.\n\nThey said that one of the major objectives of the new law was to bring businesses under automation to ensure maintenance of proper accounts.\n\nThe revenue board will also motivate the businesses which pay VAT at comparatively higher rates like 7 per cent and 9 per cent to accept the benefits of online system.\n\nMore about:'
