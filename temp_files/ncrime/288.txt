b"British Columbia ends high heel dress code requirements..British Columbia ends high heel dress code requirements.\nA Canadian province has scrapped the dress code which requires female employees to wear high heels.\n\nThe government of British Columbia says the requirement is discriminatory as well as being a health and safety issue because they are dangerous.\n\nIt says that high heel wearers face a risk of physical injury from slipping or falling as well as possible damage to the feet, legs and back.\n\nFootwear should be designed to allow workers to operate safely, it says.\n\nThe announcement of the ban comes after a provincial Green Party politician in March introduced a bill in the BC legislature aimed at preventing employers from setting gender-based footwear requirements.\n\nBC Green Party leader Andrew Weaver filed a private member's bill \xe2\x80\x98designed to prevent employers from setting varying footwear and other requirements based on gender, gender expression or gender identity\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nHis bill covered all workplaces, including retail and corporate offices. But instead of implementing it, the provincial government opted instead to amend footwear rules under the Workers' Compensation Act.\n\nBC premier Christy Clark said that in some provincial workplaces, women were unfairly required to wear high heels.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Like most British Columbians, our government thinks this is wrong. That is why we're changing this regulation to stop this unsafe and discriminatory practice,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\n\nThe new regulation states that workplace footwear must be of \xe2\x80\x98a design, construction and material that allows the worker to safely perform their work and ensures that employers cannot require footwear contrary to this standard\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nThe new guidelines, drafted by WorkSafeBC, are expected to be available by the end of April.\n\nHigh heels - and whether women should be required to wear them in the workplace, or at the Cannes film festival - has become a fashion flashpoint in recent years.\n\nIn Canada, much of the debate around dress codes for female employees has centred around the restaurant industry, where critics have said gender-specific dress codes are too common and based on stereotypes or sexist ideas of how a woman should dress."
