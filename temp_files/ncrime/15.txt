Of which,\n\nonly 36,000 businesses submit VAT returns regularly.\n\nOn the other hand, more than 55,000 businesses so far received e-BINs from the VAT online system of the NBR.\n\nOf them, 35,000 businesses replaced their old BINs with e-BINs while 20,000 businesses received fresh e-BINs.\n\nOfficials of the NBR said that many businesses started using e-BINs in opening letter of credit, getting loans, conducting import and export and other business activities.\n\nThe revenue board wants to continue the automation process including online issuance of BINs as the 1991 act also supports the activities, they said.\n\nThe NBR, however, will take some days to finalise its decision on which BINs will finally persist, they said.\n\nIt will also have to bring some changes in online system of the VOP to digitise VAT returns submission process under the existing law having multiple rates of VAT.\n\nThe online system has been prepared to implement the new law with uniform 15 per cent VAT under the VAT Online Project with a cost of Tk 551 crore. Of the amount, Tk 450 crore or $60 million is being provided by the World Bank.\n\nThe revenue board drafted the new law under the prescription of the International Monetary Fund.'
