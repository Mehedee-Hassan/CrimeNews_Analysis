In some cases inspectors renew approval without inspecting the boiler.\n\nHe urged the government to bring all the boilers (approved and unapproved) under the regulation insection to save lives.\n\nIndustryAll Bangladesh Council chairman Muzibur Rahman blamed owner\xe2\x80\x99s negligence for the boiler blast.\n\nTerming the incident \xe2\x80\x98killing workers by factory owner\xe2\x80\x99, he demanded that the factory authorities be brought to book.\n\nMuzibur demanded compensation for the victims as per the convention of International Labour Organisation.\n\nThe chief boiler inspector said that the industries ministry in December last year sent a letter to the public administration ministry proposing upgrade of the office of the chief inspector of boilers with the required number of manpower to cope with the expansion and modernisation of industries in the country.\n\nThe ministry proposed increasing manpower to 235 with the setting up of five more zonal offices in Gazipur, Narayanganj, Mymensingh, Khulna and Rangpur.'
