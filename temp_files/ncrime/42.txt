b'China says India militarising border..China says India militarising border.\nChina said on Thursday it was absurd for India to use the excuse of Chinese road-building to cross over their border, and accused India of militarising its side of the frontier.\n\nA stand-off on a plateau next to the mountainous Indian state of Sikkim, which borders China, has ratcheted up tension between the neighbouring giants, who share a 3,500 km frontier, large parts of which are disputed.\n\nAccording to the Chinese interpretation of events, Indian guards crossed into China\xe2\x80\x99s Donglang region early in June and obstructed work on a road on the plateau.\n\nTroops from the two sides then confronted each other close to a valley controlled by China that separates India from Bhutan \xe2\x80\x93 a close Indian ally \xe2\x80\x93 and gives China access to the so-called Chicken\xe2\x80\x99s Neck, a thin strip of land that connects India to its remote northeastern regions.\n\nIndia has said it had warned China that construction of the road near their common border would have serious security implications.\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang, speaking at a daily news briefing, again urged India\n\nto withdraw its personnel to the Indian side \xe2\x80\x98to avoid there being an even more serious situation creating even more serious consequences\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nGeng said China did not understand what reason India had for believing the road was a security risk, and that China had every right to build roads in its own territory.\n\nIt was \xe2\x80\x98ridiculous\xe2\x80\x99 for India to cross the border on the pretext of concern over the road, he added.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Over the past few years it\xe2\x80\x99s actually been India that has in the Sikkim sector of the China-India border who has been building a great number of facilities and deploying a large number of forces,\xe2\x80\x99 Geng said.\n\nIn some areas they have been building military facilities including fortifications, he added.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether India has considered China\xe2\x80\x99s security concerns while doing these things.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\n\n'
