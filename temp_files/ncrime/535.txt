b'Swimmer Sagar faces a reality check..Swimmer Sagar faces a reality check.\nThe picture collected from the official Facebook page of Mahfizur Rahman Sagar shows the Bangladeshi swimmer during training in Thailand.\n\nCountry\xe2\x80\x99s leading freestyle swimmer Mahfizur Rahman Sagar on Tuesday said he was looking to deliver his best in the forthcoming 17th FINA World Championships, scheduled in Budapest, Hungary from July 14 to 30.\n\nSagar, who is undergoing high performance training in Thailand for the second consecutive year in a one-year long FINA scholarship, said that it improved his performance markedly.\n\nSpeaking to New Age over phone, Sagar, who failed to deliver his best in last year\xe2\x80\x99s South Asian Games due to a shoulder injury, shared how his Spanish coaches helped him to find his form in the training camp.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Here I am spending 20 hours a week in the pool and swimming at least 12 to 14 kilometres per day under my Spanish instructor,\xe2\x80\x99 said the 24-year old swimmer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Apart from that I have to spend few hours in the gym to boost our fitness level. And such rigorous training schedule helped me to recover from my injury,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\nSagar set his best timing in the 50-metre freestyle in last year\xe2\x80\x99s Rio Olympics by clocking 23.92 seconds to be placed fifth in the heat among eight participants.\n\nHe said that he improved his timing in the event by .30 seconds during the training which could be enough for winning medal at least in the regional competitions.\n\nHis timing in 100-metre freestyle and 200-metrem freestyle improved by one second and six seconds respectively, said the Bangladesh Navy swimmer, who claimed seven medals in last SA Games but no gold or silver medals, only bronzes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Here we get all the modern training facilities that I never expect in my country,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sagar referring to the facilities that were made available to him in Thailand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Under such a top-class Spanish coach [Miguel Angel Lopez Alvarado], I was gradually improving my timing.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nSagar\xe2\x80\x99s Spanish coach Lopez, who has more than 20 years experience as a swimming coach at elite level, steering able-bodied and disabled swimmers to great heights, was also positive about his progress\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I was satisfied with his [Sagar] evolution until he got injured [before SA Games],\xe2\x80\x99 said Lopez.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98He broke his personal record by over 5 seconds. Another drop like that in 2020 he would be semi-finalists in Tokyo at the Olympics,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\nLopez lauded Sagar\xe2\x80\x99s penchant for hard-work.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98He works fantastic. Last year he had an injury and now he has recovered from it almost 90 per cent. He is [a] great team-mate and great worker,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lopez.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98He trains twenty four hours per week, 10 sessions of two hours in the water and four sessions of weights per week.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nThe Spanish coach, whose dossier of former charges included three-time triathlon world champion and Olympic silver medallist Javier Gomez, arguably the best swimmer in triathlon history, however, said that compared to other South Asian swimmers Sagar has miles to go.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Actually he broke all national records there [in SA Games in India] from the 50 to the 1500-metre and broke the former South Asian records also. But what happened was that the others went even faster,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.'
