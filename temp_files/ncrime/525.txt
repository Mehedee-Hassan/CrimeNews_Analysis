A team of surgeons spent several months mapping out a procedure to reconstruct her anatomy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98A twin had grown out of her pelvis but the twin was only part of a twin... The problem is there\xe2\x80\x99s no rulebook for this because she\xe2\x80\x99s a very unique individual so you have to try\n\nand work out what was where,\xe2\x80\x99 Chris Kimber, the paediatric surgery head at Monash Children\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital, said. \xe2\x80\x98When Choity arrived in Australia, she was very malnourished, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t walk properly at all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Kimber.\n\nWorking in consultation with experts from Europe and the United States, the surgeons planned a procedure that involved removing the remains of the third leg \xe2\x80\x93 part of which was earlier cut off in Bangladesh \xe2\x80\x93 as well as taking out, disconnecting and reconnecting other organs.\n\nChoity\xe2\x80\x99s condition meant that body parts from a twin developed in her perineum\xe2\x80\x94the area between the anus and the vulva. Surgeons spent countless hours examining her under anaesthetic and found she had two rectums, anuses, vaginas and uteruses. She was also incontinent.\n\nThe surgery, which Kimber said was \xe2\x80\x98extremely rare\xe2\x80\x99, was finally carried out in November and involved eight doctors who specialise in genital and pelvic reconstructions working on the girl for eight hours.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We spent three or four months thinking about it, presenting it to other doctors, getting ideas from around the world, and then based on lots of world opinion, we were able to come up with something that clearly works,\xe2\x80\x99 he added.\n\nA key triumph for the surgeons, including Kimber, was that they were able to help her become continent, which Kimber said was \xe2\x80\x98extraordinary\xe2\x80\x99. \xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good,\xe2\x80\x99 he added.\n\nThe little girl is also partially blind, but an ophthalmologist\xe2\x80\x99s examination at the hospital found her sight could not be improved. But she has sufficient sight to now walk and run like other children, to the delight of her 22-year-old mother.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Everything is good now... she can play like every baby,\xe2\x80\x99 Shima Khatun told broadcaster Channel Nine on Thursday, adding that she was looking forward to returning to her village outside Dhaka with her daughter and being reunited with her husband.\n\n\n\n'
