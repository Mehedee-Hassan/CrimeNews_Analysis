It will definitely encourage the girls to take the sport seriously,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\n\nKawasaki Badminton Club, one of three clubs who formed both men\xe2\x80\x99s and women\xe2\x80\x99s team last edition, asked the federation to discuss the matter with the participation clubs before finalising the decision.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Personally I support this initiative,\xe2\x80\x99 said club chairman Ohiduzzaman Razu, also president of Badminton Players\xe2\x80\x99 Welfare Association.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98But the federation must discuss it with clubs because most of them are suffering from lack of fund. With the new format clubs would have to spend more money to form their squad,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.'
