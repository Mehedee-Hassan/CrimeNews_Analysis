b'Qatar responds to demands after deadline extended..Qatar responds to demands after deadline extended.\nQatar on Monday responded to a list of demands from Saudi Arabia and its allies after they agreed to give a defiant Doha another 48 hours to address their grievances.\n\nDetails of the response were not immediately available, but a Gulf official said that Qatari foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani had delivered it during a short visit to Kuwait, which is acting as a mediator in the crisis.\n\nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt had announced in the early hours of Monday they were pushing back a deadline for Qatar to agree to a list of 13 demands they issued on June 22.\n\nA joint statement said they were extending the ultimatum, which had been due to expire at the end of the day on Sunday, at the request of Kuwait\xe2\x80\x99s emir.\n\nThe demands included Doha ending support for the Muslim Brotherhood, closing broadcaster Al-Jazeera, downgrading diplomatic ties with Iran and shutting down a Turkish military base in the emirate.\n\nSheikh Mohammed had earlier said the list of demands was \xe2\x80\x98made to be rejected\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nSaudi Arabia and its allies announced on June 5 they were severing ties with their Gulf neighbour, sparking the worst diplomatic crisis to hit the region in decades.\n\nThey accused Qatar of supporting extremism and of being too close to Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s regional arch-rival Iran, which Doha has strongly denied.\n\nThe crisis has raised concerns of growing instability in the region, home to some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest energy exporters and several key Western allies who host US military bases.\n\nGerman foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel, who on Monday starts a tour of several Gulf states, called for \xe2\x80\x98serious dialogue\xe2\x80\x99 to end the crisis.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We are worried that the distrust and the disunity could weaken all the parties concerned as well as the entire peninsula,\xe2\x80\x99 said Gabriel, who will visit Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.\n\nRiyadh and its supporters have already severed air, sea and ground links with Qatar, cutting off vital routes for imports including food.\n\nThey also ordered Qatari citizens to leave their territories and took various steps against Qatari firms and financial institutions.\n\nIt is unclear what further measures will be taken if Qatar fails to meet the demands, but the UAE\xe2\x80\x99s ambassador to Russia Omar Ghobash warned last week that further sanctions could be imposed.\n\nAs well as expelling Qatar from the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council, Riyadh and its allies could tell their economic partners to choose between business with them or with Doha, he told Britain\xe2\x80\x99s Guardian newspaper.\n\nQatar has long pursued a more independent foreign policy than many of its neighbours, who tend to follow the lead of regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia.\n\nDoha has said it is ready for talks to end the crisis. Kuwait, which unlike most of its GCC neighbours has not cut ties with Qatar, has been heading up mediation efforts.\n\nUS secretary of state Rex Tillerson has also called for compromise and hosted senior Gulf officials, but his efforts have been undermined by remarks from president Donald Trump apparently supporting Riyadh\xe2\x80\x99s position.\n\nTrump spoke separately on Sunday with the Saudi king, Abu Dhabi\xe2\x80\x99s crown prince and the Qatari emir on his concerns over the dispute, the White House said.\n\nTrump \xe2\x80\x98underscored that unity in the region is critical,\xe2\x80\x99 the statement said, but also \xe2\x80\x98reiterated the importance of stopping terrorist financing and discrediting extremist ideology.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nEgypt said it would host the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain on Wednesday to discuss the crisis.\n\nThe 13 demands have not been officially published, but a Kuwaiti diplomatic source confirmed on Monday that the list as it has appeared in the media was genuine.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about:'
