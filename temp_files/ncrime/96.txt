b'Barca salvage draw with late goal..Barca salvage draw with late goal.\nBarcelona\xe2\x80\x99s La Liga title challenge suffered a huge blow as the Spanish champions were controversially held 1-1 at Real Betis despite Luis Suarez\xe2\x80\x99s last minute equaliser on Sunday.\n\nAleix Alegria gave Betis the lead their dominance deserved 15 minutes from time when he bundled home from close range after Marc-Andre ter Stegen flapped at a corner.\n\nHowever, Barca were rightly infuriated seconds later as the ball clearly crossed the Betis goalline, but no goal was given by referee Alejandro Jose Hernandez.\n\nSuarez did at least rescue a point in the dying seconds, though, as he slotted home Lionel Messi\xe2\x80\x99s through ball for his 21st goal of the season.\n\nBarca move above Sevilla into second on goal difference, but remain a point adrift of Real Madrid, who have two games in hand, the first of which comes at home to Real Sociedad later on Sunday.\n\nSevilla are also in action later at Espanyol.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We have to help the referees,\xe2\x80\x99 Barca boss Luis Enrique told BeIN Sports Spain.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The technology can help them. I say that for all situations not just ones that go for me, but against me too.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nSuarez was less understanding as he claimed the ball \xe2\x80\x98was a metre over the line.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nUltimately Enrique paid the price for again heavily rotating his side with Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s Copa del Rey semi-final, first leg at Atletico Madrid in mind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The feeling I have is that we have won one point (not lost two),\xe2\x80\x99 he added.\n\nEnrique made six changes in all, including three of the back four and Betis took advantage with a bright start.\n\nTer Stegen was forced into saves from Ruben Castro and Dani Ceballos early on.\n\nHowever, Barca arguably had the best chance of the first-half when Antonio Adan flew off his line to deny Neymar from another scintillating Messi pass.\n\nEnrique made all three of his substitutions early in the second period, but Barca were still struggling to gain a foothold under Betis\xe2\x80\x99 intense pressing.\n\nCeballos saw a dipping long-range effort come back off the bar before Castro struck the post with Ter Stegen beaten at his near post.\n\nThe German goalkeeper had a moment to forget for the opening goal as he failed to get a good connection on an attempted punch under pressure from two Betis players and the ball fell kindly for Alegria to tap home.\n\nConceding appeared to wake Barca from their slumber and they were doubly denied by Hernandez seconds later as Neymar went down inside the area and the ball ricocheted towards the Betis goal off Riza Durmisi.\n\nReplays showed the ball clearly went over the line before Alissa Mandi cleared, but La Liga\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to implement goal line technology due to pricing fears cost Barca dearly as no goal was given.\n\nAnother goal line clearance prevented Aleix Vidal\xe2\x80\x99s deflected cross levelling for Barca moments later.\n\nBetis should have sealed the three points when Castro broke clear on goal eight minutes from time, but Ter Stegen redeemed himself with a fine save.\n\nAnd that miss proved crucial as Messi finally found the space to slip a pass through the Betis defence and Suarez dispatched the ball into the far corner.\n\nMore about:'
