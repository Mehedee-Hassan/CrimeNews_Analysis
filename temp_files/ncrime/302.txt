b'Root and Stokes revive England..Root and Stokes revive England.\nEngland captain Joe Root plays a shot during the opening day of their first Test against South Africa at Lord\xe2\x80\x99s in London on Thursday. \xe2\x80\x94 Reuters photo\n\nJoe Root and Ben Stokes marked their first Test innings as England captain and vice-captain respectively with fifties as the hosts fought back on the first day of the series opener against South Africa at Lord\xe2\x80\x99s on Thursday.\n\nEngland were 182 for four at tea, having not lost a wicket in a session that saw them score exactly 100 runs after they had been in deep in trouble at 82 for four come lunch.\n\nRoot, who won the toss, was 79 not out and left-hander Stokes 52 not out, with the pair\xe2\x80\x99s unbroken stand worth 106 runs.\n\nStokes took the attack to the Proteas in the first of this four-Test series, driving spinner Keshav Maharaj for six.\n\nBut he had a moment of good fortune when \xe2\x80\x98bowled\xe2\x80\x99 off a Morne Morkel no-ball on 44, although the fast bowler had over-stepped considerably.\n\nRoot, 33 not out at lunch, completed an 89-ball fifty including seven fours and showed plenty of deft touches, including a late cut boundary off Morkel.\n\nEarlier, perhaps encouraged by the blue skies overhead and Lord\xe2\x80\x99s reputation as a good batting pitch, Root opted to bat first.\n\nBut a green-tinged surface also gave the bowlers hope of early movement.\n\nAlastair Cook, in his first Test since resigning as England captain in February, had made just three when he flat-footedly chased a Vernon Philander delivery outside off stump and was caught behind.\n\nSouth Africa-born Keaton Jennings, who played in the same Johannesburg school side as Proteas wicket-keeper Quinton de Kock before opting for England, fell next on his home debut.\n\nCook\xe2\x80\x99s fellow left-handed opener was lbw to Philander for eight after not getting that far forward.\n\nUmpire S Ravi took his time before raising the finger, with England eventually opting against a review.\n\nReplays showed the ball had just pitched outside leg stump and was missing the stumps, meaning a challenge would have seen the Indian\xe2\x80\x99s decision overturned.\n\nThe 32-year-old Philander, fit following an ankle injury sustained while playing for English county side Sussex, had once again shown that an ability to move the ball both ways more than compensated for a lack of express pace.\n\nHe\xe2\x80\x99d now taken two wickets for three runs in eight balls to leave England 17 for two.\n\nPhilander\xe2\x80\x99s last Test at Lord\xe2\x80\x99s saw him return second-innings figures of five for 30 in a 51-run win that gave South Africa a 2-0 victory in a three-match series in 2012.\n\nRoot, meanwhile, was fortunate, when on five a top-edged hook off Kagiso Rabada just cleared substitute fielder Aiden Markram at long leg.\n\nJennings\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal may have had some influence on the exit of the third left-handed member of England\xe2\x80\x99s top three, Gary Ballance.\n\nRecalled for a third crack at Test cricket after churning out the runs for Yorkshire this season, Ballance was lbw to Morkel, altering his delivery angle to around the wicket, for 20.\n\nHaving not reviewed Jennings\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal, England challenged Ravi\xe2\x80\x99s decision on this occasion.'
