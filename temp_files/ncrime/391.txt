b"Night-time loo trips 'linked to salt in diet'..Night-time loo trips 'linked to salt in diet'.\nPeople who wake at night with an urge to go to the loo may need to cut back on salt in their diets, doctors from Japan are suggesting.\n\nThe problem - called nocturia - which mainly affects the over-60s, leads to disrupted sleep and can significantly affect people's lives.\n\nIn a study of more than 300 volunteers, researchers found that reduced salt intake led people to urinate less.\n\nAdvice to follow a sensible diet could help improve symptoms, UK doctors said.\n\nThe researchers, from Nagasaki University, presented their findings at the European Society of Urology congress in London.\n\nThey followed patients who had a high salt intake and sleeping problems for three months, after giving them advice to cut back on salt in their diet.\n\nOn average, trips to the loo fell from more than twice a night to just one.\n\nThis happened at night as well as during the day, and their quality of life also improved.\n\nConversely, 98 people in the study ended up eating more salt than normal and found they went to the loo more often at night-time.\n\nStudy author Matsuo Tomohiro said larger studies were needed to confirm the link but the results could offer help for older people.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98This work holds out the possibility that a simply dietary modification might significantly improve the quality of life for many people,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\nProfessor Marcus Drake, a nocturia expert from the University of Bristol, said the amount of salt people ate was not generally considered to be a cause of nocturia.\n\nUsually, doctors tended to focus on the volume of water patients drank before bedtime and on bladder and prostate problems (in men), he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Here we have a useful study showing how we need to consider all influences to get the best chance of improving the symptom.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nThe need to wake up at night to empty the bladder affects more than half of men and women over the age of 50.\n\nIt is particularly common in elderly people, many of whom get up at least twice a night.\n\nWhen you start to need to make two or more trips to the bathroom at night, sleep is being disturbed - which can lead to stress, tiredness and irritability.\n\nHormonal changes do happen as we age, making us produce more urine at night.\n\nMen's prostate glands also often start growing with age.\n\nAn enlarged prostate can press on the tube that urine passes through before leaving the body, increasing the need to pass urine.\n\nBut this isn't the whole story.\n\nNocturia can be a sign of an underlying health problem, such as diabetes, heart problems or sleep-related conditions, such as sleep apnoea.\n\nAdults in the UK are recommended to eat no more than 6g of salt a day, equal to 2.4g of sodium.\n\nChildren should eat less - only 2g of salt for ages one to three, rising to 5g for seven to 10-year-olds. After age 11, children can have up to 6g.\n\nBread and breakfast cereals can contain more salt than you think. Bacon, ham, cheese, crisps and pasta sauces are also high in salt.\n\nWhen buying food, look at the figure for salt per 100g on the packaging.\n\nHigh salt content is more than 1.5g salt (0.6g sodium) per 100g.
