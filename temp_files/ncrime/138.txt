b'Bangladesh football buried in Bhutan..Bangladesh football buried in Bhutan.\nBangladesh\xe2\x80\x99s hopes of advancing to the Asian Cup qualification stage ended after a humiliating 1-3 defeat to hosts Bhutan at the Changlimithang Stadium in Thimpu on Monday.\n\nForward Chengcho Gyeltshen scored a brace in the either halves after Jigme Dorji put Bhutan ahead in the fourth minute.\n\nAtiqur Rahman Meshu momentarily revived some hopes of Bangladesh, who needed a scoring draw, when he pulled one goal back to make the scoreline 1-2 at one stage before Bhutan struck again to seal the deal.\n\nWith their remarkable victory, which was their first ever international win over Bangladesh in nine meetings, Bhutan booked a spot in the 24-nation 2019 Asian Cup qualification group stage.\n\nIt came as a doomsday for Bangladesh, who will be now at the mercy of FIFA and AFC for international football in next three years.\n\nBhutan, who seemed aggressive from the beginning of the game, put immense pressure on Bangladesh defense by utilising two wings and took only four minutes to take the lead.\n\nBangladesh\xe2\x80\x99s defense put a horrible display as they failed to mark Bhutan defender Jigme Dorji, who comfortably headed home following a corner.\n\nChengcho, who led the Bhutan\xe2\x80\x99s attacking third with his speed and skill, doubled the lead in the 26th minute after another awful display by Bangladesh\xe2\x80\x99s back-four.\n\nChengcho found a long ball falling in the edge of the box and he outmuscled his marker Mamun Miah before brilliantly headed the ball home over advancing keeper Ashraful Islam Rana.\n\nBangladesh tried to control the midfield in the second half and reduced the margin in the 63rd minute when Meshu\xe2\x80\x99s head following a Mamunul Islam\xe2\x80\x99s free kick from right found the far corner of the net.\n\nHowever, Chengcho showed his skill again in the 76th minute when the speedy striker dodged past two defenders before slotting home with a powerful strike from the edge of the box.\n\nBhutan striker wasted a chance of celebrating a hat-trick three minutes later when his shot from the spot was saved by goalkeeper Rana after Mamun Miah handed down a shot of Bhutan captain Karma Tshering inside the box that forced the referee to indicate penalty against Bangladesh.\n\nBangladesh\xe2\x80\x99s Belgian coach Tom Saintfiet made three substitutions in the match to boost the attack by sending Jewel Rana, Zahid Hasan Ameli and Enamul Haq in place of Enamul Hossain Sarif, Shakhwat Hossain Rony and Mohammad Abdullah but all his efforts went in vain.\n\nRESULT\n\nBhutan 3 (Jigme Dorji 4, Chngcho Gyeltshen 26, 76) v Bangladesh 1 (Meshu 63)'
