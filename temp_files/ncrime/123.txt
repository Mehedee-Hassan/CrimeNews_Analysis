I also made some top-class chip-putts today. However, the highlight of my round was the tee shot on the second that stopped just a foot from the pin,\xe2\x80\x99 he added.\n\nDespite showcasing some brilliant performance Siddik, who produced the best performance in the day by making 66 in the second round, said the course was not easy and did not help even the locals.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The BGCC course is playing tough due to the windy conditions and I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel that I have the advantage of local knowledge here since I\xe2\x80\x99m playing at this magnificent venue after almost 16 years. \xe2\x80\x98\n\nHe added that he will not be thinking too far in the final day and will just focus on the routine.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The aim in the final round will be to play according to the situation by not getting too ahead of myself. I\xe2\x80\x99ll follow my usual routine and not think too much about the scores.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nSiddik also made the best score on the day with 67 while another local player Jamal Hossain Mollah had a good day as he made 69 to end on the 10th position with a total of one-over-par 217.\n\nJamal, who made a dismal start with six-over-par in the opening day, was trailing behind seven Indians, who were occupying the places from two to nine.'
