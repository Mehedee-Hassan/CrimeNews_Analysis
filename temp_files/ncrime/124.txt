b'EU-China summit in context of global game..EU-China summit in context of global game.\nThe scope and nature of the development of Sino-European relations will be determined by both internal and external complex factors for each of the members of the emerging \xe2\x80\x98EU-China\xe2\x80\x99 tandem. And all of these factors by themselves are highly dynamic, writes Vladimir Terehov\n\n\n\nTHIS year\xe2\x80\x99s annual EU-China Summit, which was held on June 2, deserves special attention since it has occurred in a period of radical progress in the political world, as a whole, and the relationships between the main participants of the global game, in particular.\n\nSigns of such developments began to take shape a long time ago. However, the impetus for their public manifestation was the election as president of the United States of Trump, who continues performing the role of world leader (so annoying to Americans) unabatedly. The process launched by the new president and aimed at the revaluation of the format of US participation in a global political game is the first (among several major) of its new features.\n\nThe second feature, closely (inter)related to the first, is the transformation of China into the second world power.\n\nThis is mainly due to the third feature, which is determined by the movement (probably forever) of the table of the global political game from the European continent to the Asia Pacific region. Despite the rhetoric of Trump at the last NATO Summit, which reflected the above inertia, key interests of the United States are being shifted in the same direction.\n\nThe fourth feature deals with the return to the global political game (in the status of the leading participants) of the losers both of the Second World War and the Cold War. We are talking about Japan, Germany and Russia. There is a chance that India might join these three countries.\n\nThe fifth feature is due to the uncertainty of prospects related to the development of relations between two major world players, i.e. the United States and China. This results in an increase for Beijing of the role of comprehensive cooperation with \xe2\x80\x98Europe\xe2\x80\x99 in relationship with which there are almost no problems of a political nature.\n\nFinally, the sixth feature is determined by the very real prospect of a complete reformatting of transatlantic relations, which directly follows the comments of German chancellor Angela Merkel concerning the results of the G-7 Summit held late May 2017 in Sicily.\n\nAll these features of the current phase of the geopolitical game predetermine a mutual interest in the development of comprehensive Sino-European relations.\n\nHowever, recently, the following question has become more acute: what is meant by \xe2\x80\x98modern Europe\xe2\x80\x99? Does it have any future headed by Germany, or will the latter be forced (against its preferences) to become a fully independent player? This is despite the fact that, let us say again, the European continent probably will never be in the centre of the global game in any scenario of its development. In case of the most unfavourable scenario, Europe will switch with Asia those roles that these continents have played in the Second World War.\n\nHowever, the question of the future of \xe2\x80\x98Europe\xe2\x80\x99 remains among the priorities of Chinese foreign policy. This is also because today, the EU shares with the US the first or second places as the foreign economic partners of China.\n\nIn recent years, the Sino-European trade has been at the level of USD 600 billion. So far, the sphere of mutual investments is lagging behind, which has been one of the main topics of the bilateral (complex) negotiations of recent years. The Europeans accuse their Chinese partners of dumping the prices for the products supplied, which serves as an excuse for refusing to grant China the market economy status.\n\nIn fact, a recent visit of Chinese prime minister Li Keqiang to Europe (with the stated goal of participating in the above bilateral forum at the highest level in Brussels) was devoted precisely to the strengthening of political relations with the EU, as well as addressing challenges in the field of economic cooperation.\n\nAt the same time, the preliminary visit by the Chinese prime minister to Berlin, where he held talks with chancellor Angela Merkel, was quite natural, since the leadership role of Germany in the EU is also manifested in relations with China.\n\nAt the end of 2016, China was for the first time ranked first in the list of the trading partners of Germany, having displaced the US (thus giving way for France too). Last year, the volume of the German-Chinese trade reached $180 billion, which amounted to 30 per cent of the trade of China with all EU member states.\n\nApparently, Chinese prime minister was immersed in a completely positive atmosphere in Berlin and Brussels. Back in February, having referred to the tendency of protectionism of the new US administration, vice-chancellor of Germany Sigmar Gabriel said that the EU should reinforce the trend towards increasing economic ties with China.\n\nThe negotiations in both European capitals addressed one of the key problems of the Sino-European relations that is associated with the (alleged) underestimation of the real prices of goods exported by China. Using their own legislation, European countries still impose duties corresponding to the \xe2\x80\x98correct\xe2\x80\x99 valuation of Chinese imported goods on them. Angela Merkel and the EU leadership promised the Chinese prime minister to \xe2\x80\x98consider\xe2\x80\x99 eliminating such practices.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the real reason for such a practice is the concern about the possible impact on the European economy in case of the duty-free access of Chinese goods onto EU markets. We should also note that today, the EU-China trade deficit already amounts to $200 billion, ie a third of the total deficit volume.\n\nTherefore, it remains unclear how significant will the factor of \xe2\x80\x98geopolitical expediency\xe2\x80\x99 in the process of implementing the statements on the desire to expand economic ties with China be for Europeans. Will it be outweighed by the factor of \xe2\x80\x98economic feasibility\xe2\x80\x99 (as has been observed in recent years)?\n\nOne thing is clear: addressing the issues in the current format of economic relations can only be achieved in case of the mutual movement of China and the EU towards each other.\n\nThe success of this movement will be judged by the progress of the talks on the following topics: eliminating \xe2\x80\x98discrimination\xe2\x80\x99 against Chinese goods imported by Europeans, creating favourable conditions for mutual investment and, finally, concluding free trade agreements.\n\nDuring the visit, the high Chinese guest addressed the question of what modern Europe really is. Due to the aforementioned reasons (and in connection with a specific reason to do with Brexit), the Chinese leadership has recently emphasised the desirability of maintaining the unity of the EU. The Chinese prime minister confirmed this position during his speech in Brussels.\n\nEvidence of the rapprochement of the Sino-European relations was to become a negative assessment made by both parties to a statement by Trump on the US withdrawal from the Paris \xe2\x80\x98climate agreement.\xe2\x80\x99 Here, however, some comments deserve to be made.\n\nFor China, the problem of the influence of human activity on the environment is real (almost already catastrophic) in its nature. The very emergence of this problem has become one of the most negative (and inevitable) consequences of the strategy for accelerated economic development of China in recent decades.\n\nFor Europeans, \xe2\x80\x98the fight against climate change\xe2\x80\x99, along with the topic of protecting various rights (for women, children, sexual minorities) is an element of a specific \xe2\x80\x98creed\xe2\x80\x99 that they try to impose on other countries.\n\nHowever, China may develop interest in European technological achievements in the field of purification of industrial emissions into the atmosphere. It is these issues, among others, that were apparently implied when Chinese prime minister talked about the \xe2\x80\x98innovative character\xe2\x80\x99 of a new stage of development of relations with the leading EU member states.\n\nHowever, we cannot exclude the fact that (taking into account the cost factor for the introduction in the scale of the Chinese economy) China\xe2\x80\x99s interest in these technologies will be mainly of an academic nature.\n\nThe latter presents an impetus to address the national context of the Chinese prime minister\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Europe. This mainly concerns the course for radical change in the entire economic organism of the country that was adopted at the turn of 2015\xe2\x80\x932016.\n\nToday, it is impossible to predict the consequences of the practical implementation of talks about the restructuring of the Chinese economy in China in line with the \xe2\x80\x98Industry 4.0\xe2\x80\x99 concept drawn from the same \xe2\x80\x98Europe.\xe2\x80\x99 One thing is certain: such a shift will be painful and dangerous for internal stability.\n\nThus, the scope and nature of the development of Sino-European relations will be determined by both internal and external complex factors for each of the members of the emerging \xe2\x80\x98EU-China\xe2\x80\x99 tandem. And all of these factors by themselves are highly dynamic.\n\nNew Eastern Outlook, July 2.
