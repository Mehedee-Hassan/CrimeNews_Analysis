b"Bangladeshi entries feature impact of colonisation..Bangladeshi entries feature impact of colonisation.\nA visitor looks at ink drawings by Zainul Abedin on display at a gallery in Germany as part of Documenta exhibition.\n\nThree Bangladeshi artworks featuring adverse impact of colonisation are now on display at a prestigious art exhibition in Germany.\n\nAlong with the avant-garde and experimental artworks from across the world, the exhibition, Documenta, which has been taking place every five years in Kassel, Germany since 1955, displays two ink drawings on the 1943 famine during the British colonial period by Zainul Abedin and a video art featuring newly independent country Bangladesh's struggles in the international arena in 1970s by Naeem Mohaiemen.\n\nThe ongoing show, 14th edition of Documenta, began on Saturday and it will continue till 17 September.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The contextualisation of these artworks from the early 1940's in the exhibition resonates transversally with the complex history of the World War and the regime of austerity, violence and oppression it reinforced in the various parts of the world then occupied as colonies\xe2\x80\x99, writes artistic director of 14th edition of Documenta Adam Szymczyk.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Showing Abedin and other Bengal School artists who have dealt with the famine history will not only raise the attention to their artistic oeuvre, but also provide a deeper understanding of a pivotal moment in modern history and Europe's colonial legacy\xe2\x80\x99, he adds.\n\nFather of Bangladeshi modern art, Zainul Abedin's famous famine series powerfully captures the tragic and often overlooked episode of the Bengal famine of 1943, during which an estimated two-million people died while the British colonial government was at war.\n\nThe late Zainul\xe2\x80\x99s participating two ink drawings belong to the private collection of Abul Khair, the chairman of Bengal Foundation.\n\nNaeem 's three-channel film \xe2\x80\x98Two Meetings and a Funeral\xe2\x80\x99 (2017) features a new dimension of colonisation by depicting Bangladesh's historical pivot between the 1973 Non Aligned Movement meeting in Algeria, and its' ideological opponent, the 1974 Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) meeting in Lahore.\n\nCentring the country's navigation of these two meetings while it fought for UN recognition (vetoed by China as proxy for Pakistan), the project considers the erosion of the idea of the third world as a potential space for de-colonialism, liberation theology, and socialism.\n\nThe film was co-commissioned by Sharjah Art Foundation and JustFilms/Ford Foundation. It is supported by Arts Council England, Tensta Konsthall (Sweden), and Bengal Foundation.\n\nThe participating entries from Bangladesh have been promoted by Bengal Foundation as part of its initiatives of promoting local art to the international arena.\n\nAbout the selection, Tanzim Wahab, chief curator of the foundation said, \xe2\x80\x98Zainul is one of the most significant figures of the history of Bangladeshi modern art. Naeem represents, on the other hand, the global language of contemporary art.\xe2\x80\x99"
