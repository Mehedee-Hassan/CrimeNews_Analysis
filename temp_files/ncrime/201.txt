Now we're thinking about it but we shouldn't disclose it (the plan) right now,\xe2\x80\x99 he told reporters after a meeting of the Cabinet Purchase Committee.\n\nTerming the task a 'critical problem', Muhith said it is not clear whether the new plan will require Parliament's approval. \xe2\x80\x98It depends on the advice of the Law Ministry.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nTaking into consideration the flat 15 percent VAT rate, the government had set a revenue target of Tk 248,190 crore through the National Board of Revenue (NBR) in the new fiscal year of 2017-18.\n\nBut following the suspension of the VAT Law, Muhith said, there will be a shortage of Tk 20,000 crore in the collection target.\n\nUnder the evolving situation, he admitted, the revenue target will not be achieved.\n\nThe finance minister said he made a statement in Parliament the first part of which was correct but there was an error in the second part. \xe2\x80\x98My first sentence was right, but my second sentence had an error. The Law Ministry will look into it,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\nMentioning that he was in discussion with the Law Ministry, Muhith said, \xe2\x80\x98I'll place it in Parliament, if necessary. I'll make a statement in the current parliament session.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nReplying to a query, the Finance Minister said he has no idea about any report that identified the involvement of local or foreign individuals with Bangladesh Bank's money heist."
