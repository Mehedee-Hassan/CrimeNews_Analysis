b'Folk dance should get emphasis..Folk dance should get emphasis.\nSeasoned dancer-choreographer Amanul Huq said different folk dance forms, that represent the tradition and heritage of the country, are disappearing due to apathy of the local dancers who these days are more into foreign dance forms.\n\nA recipient of prestigious awards like Ekushey Padak and Shilpakala Award, Amanul Huq, who began his career as a dancer in 1950s, is one of the most prominent choreographers of the country.\n\nThe veteran artiste recently spoke to New Age about the past and present situation of the dance scene of the country, influence of foreign dance forms on local dancers and others.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98There was a time when the dance scene of the country was shaped by prominent dancers like Bulbul Chowdhury and GM Mannan. They enriched the local dance forms through their fusion dance styles which combines elements from different folk dance forms,\xe2\x80\x99 said Huq, who blamed cultural aggression and influence of foreign dance forms on local dancers for the disappearance of the folk dance forms in post liberation war Bangladesh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Bangladesh has rich and diverse traditional dance forms like Dhamail, Khemta, Lathi Kehla, Chhau and many others. However, today\xe2\x80\x99s dancers rarely practice any folk dance forms rather they prefer foreign dance forms like Kathak, Bharatnatyam, Odissi, and many others even though these dances are not part of our culture,\xe2\x80\x99 said Huq, who added that he is not against the practice of foreign dance forms by local dancers. However, he urges the local dancers to practice folk dance forms alongside foreign dance.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Many of our local dancers receive dance training abroad and when they return following the completion of their training they just perform the dances which they have learnt abroad. I am not against learning foreign dance forms but it would be great if the local dancers combine some elements of the foreign dance with existing folk dances and create a dance form that would represent our culture,\xe2\x80\x99 said Huq.\n\nTo take the local dance scene forward it is important that dance is recognised in the country as a full-fledged art form, said Huq.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Dance is still not recognised as an art form in the country and it is difficult for the local dancers to support their families with dance alone,\xe2\x80\x99 said Huq, who also urged for inclusion of dance as a subject in the text books. \xe2\x80\x98Dance must be included in the academic curriculum of the country so that a healthy habit of dance develops among the people,\xe2\x80\x99 he added.\n\nMore about:'
