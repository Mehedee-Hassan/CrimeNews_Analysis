Since then he has been creating art works portraying how cities are being reduced to non-green zones.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98In the urban ruminations I have depicted both negative and aesthetic aspects of the changing urban landscape\xe2\x80\x99, said the artist.\n\nWhile Anisuzzaman\xe2\x80\x99s earlier works mainly depict construction sites, his recent works provide the viewers with a much wider picture of the transforming urban scenery. How greenery is being swallowed up by skyscrapers, which in turn is reducing the urban landscape into a desert of buildings have been realistically depicted in the displayed woodcut prints.\n\nThe prints from the Urban Ruminations series portray under construction sites and the art works from Urban Ruminations 2 provide the viewers with a larger view of the city-space where high rise buildings are featured horizontally.\n\nThe prints, with its nuanced lines, texture and desert-sand colour, depict in great detail the city-desert we now live in.\n\nIn his works from the Redeeming Space series, Anisuzzaman\xe2\x80\x99s portrayal of jumbled up electric and other wires reveal a stark truth about Dhaka. Through skillful use of space, delineation of lines and forms the artist has wonderfully depicted the scenario in his work.\n\nSkilled use of shades and tones, diverse use of colours in some of the displayed works also demand attention and acclaim.\n\nThe show, which was inaugurated on May 21, will remain open till tomorrow.'
