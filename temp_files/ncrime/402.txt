Power and water supplies have also been disrupted.\n\nNew Zealand's HMNZS Canterbury is already in operation off the coast, and will be joined later on Wednesday by Canada's HMC Vancouver, Australia's HMAS Darwin and the US destroyer USS Sampson.\n\nThe USS Sampson is the first US warship to visit New Zealand in 30 years.\n\nThe foreign warships had been destined for Auckland to take part in 75th anniversary celebrations for the New Zealand navy but diverted to help with the recovery effort.\n\nNew Zealand defence minister Gerry Brownlee said the offer of assistance was \xe2\x80\x98heartening\xe2\x80\x99, and that Japan and Singapore had also offered help.\n\nMeanwhile the cleanup is continuing in Christchurch and the capital, Wellington. Some streets remain cordoned off while safety checks are carried out on damaged buildings.\n\nOfficials say there have been up to 100,000 landslides across the affected region.\n\nNew Zealand's government-funded earthquake monitoring service Geonet said Monday's quake - actually two at the same time - had a magnitude of 7.5, making it the largest in the quake-prone country since 2009.\n\nThe US geological survey placed it at 7.8.\n\nGeonet said there had been more than 1,700 quakes and aftershocks since Monday, and that further tremors were highly likely.\n\nNew Zealand lies on the Ring of Fire, the fault line that circles virtually the entire Pacific Rim bringing frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions.\n\nChristchurch is still recovering from a 2011 earthquake that killed 185 people and destroyed the city centre."
