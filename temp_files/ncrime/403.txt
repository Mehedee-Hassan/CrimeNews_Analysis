It is precisely because of my respect for Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin and what he stood for, and my high expectations of our premier art institution which he founded, that I expressed my opinion.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I would be happy to engage with the BCS directly regarding the matter, and assure you and others that the article was intended neither to be disrespectful, nor derogatory, but with a genuine desire to see Charukala Institute attain its full potential. Debates and critical analysis are essential for intellectual growth and I would welcome such an opportunity with my peers,\xe2\x80\x99 he added.'
