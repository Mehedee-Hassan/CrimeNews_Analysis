One for participating in the international meet and the other is yearly grant. The recent letter confirmed that it [IAAF] has lifted the suspension from participating in the international meet,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We have worked hard to regain our reputation by taking part in different international meets in recent times.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We sent athletes in different meets and training courses including Asian Athletics Championship in India, Youth Asian Championship in Thailand and also sent athletes and coaches in different training courses.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I think IAAF considered our recent activities before relaxing the suspension.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nFederation secretary Abdul Rakib Montu believed that after their participation in the two world meets, IAAF would lift the full suspension.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We have regular correspondence with the IAAF,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We inform all of our activities to them [IAAF] time-to-time and also submitted the annual report of 2016.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98We are very keen to lift our full suspension. So that, we don\xe2\x80\x99t miss any international and continental meet even though we have lack of fund.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe that after Youth meet and World meet, IAAF would lift our suspension considering our recent activities.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nMore about:'
