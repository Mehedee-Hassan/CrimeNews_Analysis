At least 10 per cent of the demand would be met from renewable sources including solar power system.\n\nThe country is now producing 15,379 MW of electricity to supply to 2.49 crore customers across the country. Nearly 45 lakh households in thousand of villages of the country also got solar power system in the past few years.\n\nThe 2.49 crore customers together with the 45 lakh home solar systems effectively made electricity available to 80.0 percent of the country\xe2\x80\x99s total population, said a Power Cell official.'
