She got hooked on social media as a teenager when going through a difficult time in her life.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The online communities made me feel included and that I was worthwhile.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x98However, I soon began to neglect \xe2\x80\x98real life\xe2\x80\x99 friendships and constantly spent all my time online talking to my friends there.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I fell into a deep depressive episode aged 16, which lasted for months and was utterly horrible.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x98During this time social media made me feel worse, as I would constantly compare myself to other people and make myself feel bad.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x98When I was 19, I had another bad depressive episode. I\xe2\x80\x99d go on social media, see all my friends doing things and hate myself for not being able to do them, or feel bad that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as good a person as them.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nSocial media has also been a positive in Isla\xe2\x80\x99s life.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I have blogged a lot about mental health and I\xe2\x80\x99m quite open about it and have good conversations with people about it.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I find it gives me a platform to talk and talking with people is something I find imperative to my own health.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The online friends I made five or six years ago I\xe2\x80\x99m still friends with to this day and have met many of them in person.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nThe online survey asked participants a series of questions about whether YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook and Twitter had an impact on their health and well-being.\n\nParticipants were asked to score each platform on 14 health and well-being issues.\n\nBased on these ratings, YouTube was considered to have the most positive impact on mental health, followed by Twitter and then Facebook.\n\nSnapchat and Instagram were given the lowest scores overall.\n\nShirley Cramer, chief executive of the RSPH, said: \xe2\x80\x98It is interesting to see Instagram and Snapchat ranking as the worst for mental health and well-being - both platforms are very image-focused and it appears they may be driving feelings of inadequacy and anxiety in young people.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nIn light of the findings, public health experts are calling for social media platforms to introduce a series of checks and measures to help tackle mental health, including: pop-ups warning people that they have used social media for a long time (supported by 70 per cent of young people surveyed), social media platforms identifying users with mental health problems and \xe2\x80\x98discreetly signposting places they can get support\xe2\x80\x99, platforms highlighting when photos have been digitally manipulated - for example, fashion brands, celebrities and other advertising organisations could sign up to a voluntary code, allowing a small icon to be displayed on digitally altered photos.\n\nThe report also recommends that NHS England comes up with a vetting scheme for health and well-being information so young people are better able to judge whether information is trustworthy.\n\nCramer added: \xe2\x80\x98As the evidence grows that there may be potential harms from heavy use of social media, and as we upgrade the status of mental health within society, it is important that we have checks and balances in place to make social media less of a \xe2\x80\x98wild West\xe2\x80\x99 when it comes to young people\xe2\x80\x99s mental health and well-being.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nTom Madders, from mental health charity YoungMinds, said the recommendations could help many young people.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Increasing safety within social media platforms is an important step and one we urge Instagram and other sites to act upon.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x98But it\xe2\x80\x99s also important to recognise that simply \xe2\x80\x98protecting\xe2\x80\x99 young people from particular content types can never be the whole solution.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nHe said young people needed to understand the risks of how they behaved online and should be taught how to respond to \xe2\x80\x98harmful content that slips through filters\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nInstagram was contacted by the BBC but did not respond to a request for a comment.'
