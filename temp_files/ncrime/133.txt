b'Trump to say Western civilisation is at stake..Trump to say Western civilisation is at stake.\nPoland\xe2\x80\x99s President Andrzej Duda, right, and US President Donald Trump attend a news conference at Royal Castle, in Warsaw, Thursday July 6, 2017. \xe2\x80\x94 AP photo\n\nUS president Donald Trump is to argue that the future of Western civilisation is at stake in a keynote speech in the Polish capital Warsaw.\n\nHolding up Poland as an example of a country ready to defend Western freedoms, he will warn against the threats of \xe2\x80\x98terrorism and extremism\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nPoland\xe2\x80\x99s conservative government shares Trump\xe2\x80\x99s hostile view of immigration and strong sense of sovereignty.\n\nTrump is in Poland ahead of a G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Because as the Polish experience reminds us - the defence of the West ultimately rests not only on means but also on the will of its people to prevail,\xe2\x80\x99 Trump will say, according to excerpts released from the speech.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nWhat else will Trump say in the speech?\n\nAppearing on a stage at the monument to the 1944 Warsaw Uprising on Warsaw\xe2\x80\x99s historic Krasinski Square, Trump will also reaffirm US support for Eastern Europe ahead of his first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg, the BBC\xe2\x80\x99s James Landale in Warsaw reports.\n\nPutin called for an end to sanctions against Russia as well as trade protectionism in an editorial published in German newspaper Handelsblatt.\n\nIn another part of his speech, Trump will also make a strong attack on red tape, condemning \xe2\x80\x98the steady creep of government bureaucracy that drains the vitality and wealth of the people\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nGiving a news conference hours before the speech, Trump called on countries to demonstrate to North Korea that there were consequences for its \xe2\x80\x98very bad behaviour\xe2\x80\x99 and said \xe2\x80\x98something will have to be done about it\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nHe said America\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98strong alliance with Poland and NATO\xe2\x80\x99 remained \xe2\x80\x98critical to deterring conflict\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nHe accused Russia of \xe2\x80\x98destabilising behaviour\xe2\x80\x99 but, when asked if Russia had meddled in the US presidential election, replied, \xe2\x80\x98Nobody really knows for sure\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nHe said in reference to Syria that \xe2\x80\x98any nation which values human life can never tolerate the use of chemical weapons\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nTrump gave the news conference at Warsaw\xe2\x80\x99s Royal Castle alongside Polish president Andrzej Duda after attending a summit of 12 nations with interests in the Baltic, the Adriatic and the Black Sea - the \xe2\x80\x98Three Seas\xe2\x80\x99 summit.\n\nThe Polish government is trying to become less energy-dependent on Russia, and last month the first ever US liquefied natural gas shipment arrived.\n\nCommending American LNG, Trump told the news conference: \xe2\x80\x98You can never be held hostage to a single supplier.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nA global glut in supply, however, has depressed prices and made it difficult for LNG exporters to turn a profit, Adam Sieminski, an energy analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.\n\nWarsaw and three Baltic states have spoken against the construction of an offshore Russian gas pipeline to Germany, known as Nord Stream 2.\n\nDisappointingly perhaps for Trump and his Polish hosts only a small crowd turned out in the sunshine to greet him at the Royal Castle, the BBC\xe2\x80\x99s Adam Easton reports.\n\nHe entered through the back door so those that did come did not even catch a glimpse of him.\n\nDuda said earlier that Trump\xe2\x80\x99s visit showed Poland was a \xe2\x80\x98country that matters\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nPoland has been at odds with some other EU states over its refusal to accept refugees under a 2015 solidarity plan.\n\nA warm reception in Warsaw may benefit Trump\xe2\x80\x99s image with Americans after his earlier visit to Europe in May, Piotr Buras of the European Council on Foreign Relations, told AFP news agency.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98After his disastrous trip to Brussels and Taormina, friendly pictures with European leaders and cheering crowds at his public speech could help Trump repair his image at home,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\n\nHowever, the Polish branch of Greenpeace is using Trump\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Warsaw to protest against his decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement.\n\nThe words \xe2\x80\x98No Trump Yes Paris\xe2\x80\x99 were projected in huge green letters on the city\xe2\x80\x99s Palace of Culture and Science on Wednesday.\n\nLater on Thursday, the US leader will travel to Hamburg for what could be a potentially fractious summit.\n\nHe has fallen out with some EU nations over climate change and trade. UK prime minister Theresa May will challenge him over climate change, saying an international agreement on the issue should not be renegotiated.\n\nAid organisations are expected to hold demonstrations in Hamburg urging the heads of government to do more to tackle inequality.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s important because you have the biggest meeting of all of the leading rulers of the main countries in the world - the G20 - and I don\xe2\x80\x99t like some of the politics that they\xe2\x80\x99re doing, especially that of [Recep Tayyip] Erdogan, of Putin and of Trump,\xe2\x80\x99 one protester told the BBC.\n\nSecurity in Hamburg has been tightened, with police warning of potentially violent clashes. They have already confiscated a number of homemade weapons.'
