b'Federer poised for record triumph..Federer poised for record triumph.\nSwiss tennis player Roger Federer poses with the Laver cup, a new competition in Wimbledon, London on June 29. \xe2\x80\x94 AFP photo\n\nTwelve months after shutting down his season in the wake of a devastating semi-final defeat, Roger Federer returns to Wimbledon as favourite to capture a record-breaking eighth title and become the tournament\xe2\x80\x99s oldest champion.\n\nThe evergreen Swiss, who turns 36 in August, has stunned the critics who wrote him off as yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s man when he went down to Milos Raonic in five gruelling sets on Centre Court in 2016.\n\nThe loss forced him off tour for the remainder of the year to rest a knee injury, leaving his Grand Slam title count on 17 where it had been since 2012.\n\nFast forward a year and Federer is poised to break the tie for seven Wimbledon titles he shares with Pete Sampras and take his career tally at the majors to 19.\n\nWith eternal rivals Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic in slumps of varying degrees, and Rafael Nadal fretting over whether or not his knees will bear the stress of grass courts, it is Federer once again in the box seat.\n\nFederer, who captured a fifth Australian Open in January, will go into Wimbledon buoyed by a ninth title on the grass of Halle and refreshed by skipping the claycourt season.\n\nHowever, he will not write off his three major rivals with whom he has shared all the Wimbledon titles since his maiden triumph in 2003.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98If Andy is anything close to 100% physically, I consider him one of the big favourites to win. It\xe2\x80\x99s that simple. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same for Novak and the same for Rafa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Federer who will start his Wimbledon campaign against Alexander Dolgopolov of Ukraine.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very even when we put it all out on the line. Everybody has their own little story right now.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nFor tennis storylines of 2017, Federer shares top billing with Nadal after the Spaniard defied the doubters to win a 10th French Open.\n\nThat took him to 15 Grand Slam titles, one ahead of Sampras and just three behind Federer.\n\nBut for Nadal, Wimbledon has always been bittersweet.\n\nHe was champion in 2008 -- where he beat Federer in a final widely regarded as the greatest ever played -- and 2010 as well as finishing runner-up in 2006, 2007 and 2011.\n\nInjury forced him to skip Wimbledon in 2009 and 2016 while the years 2012-2015 saw him lose to Lukas Rosol (world ranked 100), Steve Darcis (135), Nick Kyrgios (144) and Dustin Brown (102).\n\nA fourth round run in 2014 represents his best recent effort.\n\nNadal, who could face Federer in the final, opens against John Millman of Australia, said that the first week will be crucial.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98If I am able to go through at the beginning, I think I\xe2\x80\x99m with confidence.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nDefending champion Murray is fresh off a first round exit at Queen\xe2\x80\x99s at the hands of Australian world number 90 Jordan Thompson.\n\nThe world number one, who was also Wimbledon champion in 2013, has also been dogged by a hip problem which left him grimacing in pain in training this week.\n\nMurray opens proceedings on Centre Court on Monday against lucky loser Alexander Bublik with Coach Ivan Lendl insisting the champion will be fit.\n\nDjokovic, the three-time Wimbledon champion, warmed up by claiming a morale-boosting title triumph at Eastbourne on Saturday, his first trophy since Doha in January.\n\nThe Serb was on top of the world just over 12 months ago when he arrived at Wimbledon with all four Grand Slams in his possession.\n\nHowever, a third round loss to Sam Querrey set him on a slide which has been more or less constant ever since.\n\nDjokovic faces fiery Slovakian Martin Klizan in the first round with a potential third round blockbuster against Juan Martin del Potro.'
