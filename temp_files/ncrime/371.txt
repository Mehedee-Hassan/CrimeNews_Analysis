b"'Touchscreen-toddlers' sleep less..'Touchscreen-toddlers' sleep less.\nToddlers who spend time playing on smartphones and tablets seem to get slightly less sleep than those who do not, say researchers.\n\nThe study in Scientific Reports suggests every hour spent using a touchscreen each day was linked to 15 minutes less sleep.\n\nHowever, those playing with touchscreens do develop their fine motor skills more quickly.\n\nExperts said the study was \xe2\x80\x98timely\xe2\x80\x99 but parents should not lose sleep over it.\n\nThere has been an explosion in touchscreens in the home, but understanding their impact on early childhood development has been lacking.\n\nThe study by Birkbeck, University of London, questioned 715 parents of children under three years old.\n\nIt asked how often their child played with a smartphone or tablet and about the child's sleep patterns.\n\nIt showed that 75 per cent of the toddlers used a touchscreen on a daily basis, with 51 per cent of those between six and 11 months using one, and 92 per cent of those between 25 and 36 months doing so as well.\n\nBut children who did play with touchscreens slept less at night and more in the day.\n\nOverall they had around 15 minutes less sleep for every hour of touchscreen use.\n\nTim Smith, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website: \xe2\x80\x98It isn't a massive amount when you're sleeping 10-12 hours a day in total, but every minute matters in young development because of the benefits of sleep.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nThe study is not definitive, but Smith says it \xe2\x80\x98seems to indicate touchscreens have some association with possible sleep problems\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nHowever, his research has also shown toddlers who actively use touchscreens (swiping rather than watching) accelerate their development of motor skills.\n\nSo should children be given touchscreens to play with?\n\nSmith says: \xe2\x80\x98It's very tricky right now, the science is very immature, we are really lagging behind the technology and it's too early to make clear proclamations.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nHe says the best bet is to follow similar rules for the amount of time spent in front of the TV.\n\nThat means putting a limit on the total time spent on devices, ensuring children still do physical things, ensuring that content is age-appropriate, and avoiding the screens in the hour before bedtime.\n\nAnna Joyce, a cognitive developmental researcher at Coventry University, said: \xe2\x80\x98As the first study to investigate associations between sleep and touchscreen use in infancy, this is a timely piece of research.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x98In light of these findings and what we know from previous research it may be worth parents limiting touchscreen, other media use and blue light in the hours before bedtime.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Until we know more about how touchscreens affect sleep, they shouldn't be banned completely,\xe2\x80\x99 she added.\n\nProfessor Kevin McConway, from The Open University, said: \xe2\x80\x98I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over these results, if I still had young children.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x98The children in this study used a touchscreen for about 25 minutes a day, a child who used a touchscreen for this average length of time would sleep for about 6 minutes less.\xe2\x80\x99"
