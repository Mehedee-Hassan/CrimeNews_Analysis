Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Thursday asked the civil servants to go for implementing the budget and development projects without any delay to yield better outcomes and move the country forward speedily.

She also directed them to take steps to fulfil the basic needs of the citizens, ensure social security and construction of necessary infrastructures, and generate employments.

‘We’ve the largest-ever budget and ADP this time. You’ll have to go for quick implementation of those and completion of the near-ending projects with little funds so that we can take new projects. Remain alert so that no project gets extended like elastic,’ she said.

The prime minister was addressing a function at her office marking the signing of the Annual Performance Agreement of the ministries and their subordinate bodies.

Noting that the government’s specific goal should be to ensure the country’s speedy development, she said the cabinet members are liable to parliament while MPs are liable to people. ‘Awami League is aware enough in this regard as it never forgets its election manifesto.’

Hasina said every political party should have an effective economic policy to take forward the nation and the country’s bureaucracy must act with sincerity to achieve the goal.

She also said the country’s economic policy needs to be updated in every 10 years to make it more time-befitting one.

The prime minister said the APA makes the officials responsible which helps complete development works in a specific timeframe, enabling people to enjoy its benefits.

The APA is an internal mechanism of the civil administration from top to grassroots level aimed at evaluating their yearly performance and making them accountable to their responsibilities.

The government, for the fourth year, has signed the APA with the ministries and their subordinate bodies, including divisional, district and upazila-level offices.

The prime minister thanked the secretaries for signing the agreement soon after passing the budget, saying it will help implement the development projects as there is enough time.

She urged the officials to complete the paper works for implementing the projects during rainy season in the next two months and start physical works soon after the monsoon.

Finance minister AMA Muhith, public administration minister Syed Ashraful Islam, cabinet secretary Mohammad Shafiul Alam and PM’s principal secretary Kamal Abdul Naser Chowdhury, among others, addressed the function.

Security Services Division secretary Farid Uddin Ahmed Chowdhury and Cabinet Division secretary (coordination and reforms) NM Ziaul Alam delivered the welcome address.

Ministers, MPs, heads of different government organisations and senior officials were present.

Senior secretaries and secretaries in charge of various ministries and divisions handed over a copy of their respective Annual Performance Agreement to the prime minister.

Under the agreement, the ministries ascertain vision, mission and strategic goals in consistence with the development priorities of the government and undertake short- and long-term plans according to budgetary allocations.
