JU revises job of AC Robiul’s wife
The Jahangirnagar University authority on Friday made an upgraded job offer to Umme Salma, wife of Dhaka Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Robiul Karim who was killed in the July 1, 2016 extremist attack on a Gulshan cafe in Dhaka, after huge criticism.

According to a press release issued by the JU public relations office, in a fresh letter, Umme Salma was offered the post of administrative officer (education) on an ad hoc basis while the earlier offer for her appointment as a third-class officer was retracted.

On Thursday, the JU registrar office issued a letter to the AC Robiul’s wife asking her to join the university as a third-class officer though she had applied for the administrative officer post, which drew huge criticism on the social media.

The job advertisement for the administrative officer post was published in different national dailies on November 16, 2016. Salma applied for the post and appeared for the interview, but the authority appointed the wife of a university professor.
